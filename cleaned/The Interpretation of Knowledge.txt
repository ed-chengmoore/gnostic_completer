... they came to believe by means of signs and wonders and fabrications. the likeness that
came to be through them followed him, but through reproaches and humiliations before they
received the apprehension of a vision they fled without having heard that the christ had
been crucified. but our generation is fleeing since it does not yet even believe that the
christ is alive. in order that our faith may be holy (and) pure, not relying upon itself
actively, but maintaining itself planted in him, do not say: "whence is the patience
to measure faith?", for each one is persuaded by the things he believes. if he
disbelieves them, then he would be unable to be persuaded. but it is a great thing for a
man who has faith, since he is not in unbelief, which is the world.
now the world is the place of unfaith and the place of death. and death
exists as ... (14 lines missing)... likeness and they will not believe. a holy thing is
the faith to see the likeness. the opposite is unfaith in the likeness. the things that he
will grant them will support them. it was impossible for them to attain to the
imperishability [...] will become [...] loosen [...] those who were sent [...]. for he who
is distressed will not believe. he is unable to bring a great church, since it is gathered
out of a small gathering.
he became an emanation of the trace. for also they say about the
likeness that it is apprehended by means of his trace. the structure apprehends by means
of the likeness, but god apprehends by means of his members. he knew them before they were
begotten, and they will know him. and the one who begot each one from the first will
indwell them. he will rule over them. for it is necessary for each one ... (25 lines

carnal is the word who took him as a husband. and it is he who exists as an image, since
that one (masc.) also exists, as well as that one (fem.) who brought us forth. and she
caused him to know that she is the womb. this is a marvel of hers that she causes us to
transcend patience. but this is the marvel: he loves the one who was first to permit a
virgin [...]. it is fitting to [...] her [...] unto death [...] desire to practice ... (23
lines missing)therefore she yielded to him in her path. he was first to fix our eye upon
this virgin who is fixed to the cross that is in those places. and we see that it is her
water which the supreme authority granted to the one in whom there is a sign. this is the
water of immortality which the great powers will grant to him while he is below in the
likeness of her young son. she did not stop on his account. she [...] the [...] he became

come forth from those who are being killed.
but he was being pursued in that place by the trace produced by the
savior. and he was crucified and he died - not his own death, for he did not at all
deserve to die because of the church of mortals. and he was nailed so that they might keep
him in the church. he answered her with humiliations, since in this way he had borne the
suffering which he had suffered. for jesus is for us a likeness on account of ... (14

us in nets of flesh. since the body is a temporary dwelling which the rulers and
authorities have as an abode, the man within, after being imprisoned in the fabrication,
fell into suffering. and having compelled him to serve them, they constrained him to serve
the energies. they split the church so as to inherit ... (9 lines missing)... power to

[...] be more to her [...] him. he ... (8 lines missing)... like [...] into [...] he has
them [...] them [...] each one will be worthy [...] take him and [...] the teacher should
hide himself as if he were a god who would embrace his works and destroy them. for he also
spoke with the church and he made himself her teacher of immortality, and destroyed the
arrogant teacher by teaching her to die.
and this teacher made a living school, for that teacher has another school: while it
teaches us about the dead writings, he, on the other hand, was causing us to remove
ourselves from the surfeit of the world; we were being taught about our death through
them.
now this is his teaching: do not call to a father upon the earth. your
father, who is in heaven, is one. you are the light of the world. they are my brothers and
my fellow companions who do the will of the father. for what use is it if you gain the
world and you forfeit your soul? for when we were in the dark, we used to call many
"father," since we were ignorant of the true father. and this is the great
conception of all the sins ... (8 lines missing)... pleasure. we are like [...] him to
[...] soul [...] men who [...] the dwelling place.
what now is the faith laid down by the master who released him from the great ignorance
and the darkness of the ignorant eye? he reminded him of the good things of his father and
the race. for he said to him, "now the world is not yours, may you not esteem the
form that is in it as advantageous; rather (as) disadvantageous and (as) a
punishment." receive now the teaching of the one who was reproached - an advantage
and a profit for the soul - and receive his shape. it is the shape that exists in the
presence of the father, the word and the height, that let you know him before you have
been led astray while in (the) flesh of condemnation.
likewise i became very small, so that through my humility i might take
you up to the great height, whence you had fallen. you were taken to this pit. if now you
believe in me, it is i who shall take you above, through this shape that you see. it is i
who shall bear you upon my shoulders. enter through the rib whence you came and hide
yourself from the beasts. the burden that you bear now is not yours. whenever you (fem.)
go ... (14 lines missing)... from his glory [...] from the first. from being counted with
the female, sleep brought labor and the sabbath, which is the world. for from being
counted with the father, sleep brought the sabbath and the exodus from the world of the
beasts. for the world is from beasts and it is a beast. therefore he that is lost has been
reckoned to the crafty one, and that one is from the beasts that came forth. they put upon
him a garment of condemnation, for the female had no other garment for clothing her seed
except the one she brought on the sabbath. for no beast exists in the aeon. for the father
does not keep the sabbath, but (rather) actuates the son, and through the son he continued
to provide himself with the aeons. the father has living rational elements from which he
puts on my members as garments. the man ... (11 lines missing)... this is the name. the
[...] he emitted himself and he emitted the reproached one. the one who was reproached
changed (his) name and, along with that which would be like the reproach, he appeared as
flesh. and the humiliated one has no equipment. he has no need of the glory that is not
his; he has his own glory with the name, which is the son. now he came that we might
become glorious through the humiliated one that dwells in the places of humiliation. and
through him who was reproached we receive the forgiveness of sins. and through the one who
was reproached and the one who was redeemed we receive grace.
but who is it that redeemed the one who was reproached? it is the
emanation of the name. for just as the flesh has need of a name, so also is the flesh an
aeon that wisdom has emitted. it received the majesty that is descending, so that the aeon
might enter the one who was reproached, that we might escape the disgrace of the carcass
and be regenerated in the flesh and blood of ... (8 lines missing)... destiny. he [...]
and the aeons [...] they accepted the son although he was a complete mystery [...] each
one of his members [...] grace. when he cried out, he was separated from the church like
portions of the darkness from the mother, while his feet provided him traces, and these
scorched the path of the ascent to the father.
but what is the way and manner (in) which it (fem.) became their head?
well, it (fem.) made the dwelling place to bring forth the light to those who dwell within
him, so that they might see the ascending church. for the head drew itself up from the
pit; it was bent over the cross and it looked down to tartaros so that those below might
look above. hence, for example, when someone looks at someone, then the face of the one
who looked down looks up; so also once the head looked from the height to its members, our
members went above, where the head was. and it, the cross, was undergoing nailing for the
members, and solely that they might be able ... (7 lines missing)... have [...] because
they were like [...] slave. the consummation is thus: he whom she indicated will be
completed by the one who indicated. and the seeds that remain will endure until the all is
separated and takes shape.
and thus the decree will be fulfilled, for just as the woman who is honored until death
has the advantage of time, so too will it give birth. and this offspring will receive the
body appointed for it, and it will become perfect. he has a generous nature, since the son
of god dwells in him. and whenever he acquires the all, whatever he possesses will <be
dissolved> in the fire because it greatly despised and outraged the father.
moreover, when the great son was sent after his small brothers, he
spread abroad the edict of the father and proclaimed it, opposing the all. and he removed
the old bond of debt, the one of condemnation. and this is the edict that was: those who
made themselves enslaved have become condemned in adam. they have been brought from death,
received forgiveness for their sins, and been redeemed by ... (9 lines missing)... since
we are worthy [...] and [...] but i say [...] and these [...]. for [...] is worthy to
[...] god. and the father [...] the christ removed himself from all these, since he loves
his members with all his heart. one who is jealous sets his members against one another.
if he is not jealous, he will not be removed from (the) other members and the good which
he sees.
by having a brother who regards us as he also is, one glorifies the one
who gives us grace. moreover, it is fitting for each of us to enjoy the gift that he has
received from god, and that we not be jealous, since we know that he who is jealous is an
obstacle in his (own) path, since he destroys only himself with the gift and he is
ignorant of god. he ought to rejoice and be glad and partake of grace and bounty. does
someone have a prophetic gift? share it without hesitation. neither approach your brother
jealously nor ... (8 lines missing)... chosen as they [...] empty as they escape [...]
fallen from their [...] are ignorant that [...] in this way they have [...] them in [...]
in order that they may reflect perforce upon the things that you want them to think about
when they think about you. now your brother also has his grace: do not belittle yourself,
but rejoice and give thanks spiritually, and pray for that one, in order that you might
share the grace that dwells within him. so do not consider him foreign to you, rather,
(as) one who is yours, whom each of your <fellow> members received. by loving the
head who possesses them, you also possess the one from whom it is that these outpourings
of gifts exist among your brethren.
but is someone making progress in the word? do not be hindered by this;
do not say: ''why does he speak while i do not?", for what he says is (also) yours,
and that which discerns the word and that which speaks is the same power. the word ... (13
lines missing)... eye or a hand only, although they are a single body. those who belong to
us all serve the head together. and each one of the members reckons it as a member. they
cannot all become entirely a foot or entirely an eye or entirely a hand, since these
members will not live alone; rather they are dead. we know that they are being put to
death. so why do you love the members that are still dead, instead of those that live? how
do you know that someone is ignorant of the brethren? for you are ignorant when you hate
them and are jealous of them, since you will not receive the grace that dwells within
them, being unwilling to reconcile them to the bounty of the head. you ought to give
thanks for our members and ask that you too might be granted the grace that has been given
to them. for the word is rich, generous and kind. here he gives away gifts to his men
without jealousy, according to ... (11 lines missing)... appeared in each of the members
[...] himself [...] since they do not fight at all with one another on account of their
difference(s). rather, by laboring with one another, they will work with one another, and
if one of them suffers, they will suffer with him, and when each one is saved, they are
saved together.
moreover, if they would wait for the exodus from the (earthly) harmony, they will come
to the aeon. if they are fit to share in the (true) harmony, how much the more those who
derive from the single unity? they ought to be reconciled with one another. do not accuse
your head because it has not appointed you as an eye but rather as a finger. and do not be
jealous of that which has been put in the class of an eye or a hand or a foot, but be
thankful that you do not exist outside the body. on the contrary, you have the same head
on whose account the eye exists, as well as the hand and the foot and the rest of the
parts. why do you despise the one that is appointed as [...] it desired to [...] you
slandered [...] does not embrace [...] unmixed body [...] chosen [...] dissolve [...] of
the aeon [...] descent [...] however plucked us from <the> aeons that exist in that
place. some exist in the visible church - those who exist in the church of men - and
unanimously they proclaim to one another the pleroma of their aeon. and some exist for
death in the church on whose behalf they go - she for whom they are death - while others
are for life. therefore they are lovers of abundant life. and each of the rest endures by
his own root. he puts forth fruit that is like him, since the roots have a connection with
one another and their fruits are undivided, the best of each. they possess them, existing
for them and for one another. so let us become like the roots, since we are equal [...]
that aeon [...] those who are not ours [...] above the [...] grasp him [...] since [...]
your soul. he will [...] we gave you to him. if you purify it, it abides in me. if you
enclose it, it belongs to the devil. even if you kill his forces that are active, it will
be with you. for if the soul is dead, still it was enacted upon (by) the rulers and
authorities.
what, now, do you think of as spirit? or why do they persecute men of this sort to
death? are they not satisfied to be with the soul and seek it? for every place is excluded
from them by the men of god so long as they exist in flesh. and when they cannot see them,
since they (the men of god) live by the spirit, they tear apart what appears, as if thus
they can find them. but what is the profit for them? they are senselessly mad! they rend
their surroundings! they dig the earth! [...] him [...] hid [...] exists [...] purify
[...] however [...] after god [...] seize us [...] but we walk [...]. for if the sins are
many, how much the more now is the jealousy of the church of the savior. for each one was
capable of both (types) of transgression, namely that of an adept, and (that of) an
ordinary person. it is still a single ability that they possess. and as for us, we are
adepts at the word. if we sin against it, we sin more than gentiles. but if we surmount
every sin, we shall receive the crown of victory, even as our head was glorified by the
father.

authorities.
what, now, do you think of as spirit? or why do they persecute men of this sort to
death? are they not satisfied to be with the soul and seek it? for every place is excluded
from them by the men of god so long as they exist in flesh. and when they cannot see them,
since they (the men of god) live by the spirit, they tear apart what appears, as if thus
they can find them. but what is the profit for them? they are senselessly mad! they rend
their surroundings! they dig the earth! [...] him [...] hid [...] exists [...] purify

capable of both (types) of transgression, namely that of an adept, and (that of) an
ordinary person. it is still a single ability that they possess. and as for us, we are
adepts at the word. if we sin against it, we sin more than gentiles. but if we surmount
every sin, we shall receive the crown of victory, even as our head was glorified by the
father.

... they came to believe by means of signs and wonders and fabrications. the likeness that
came to be through them followed him, but through reproaches and humiliations before they
received the apprehension of a vision they fled without having heard that the christ had
been crucified. but our generation is fleeing since it does not yet even believe that the
christ is alive. in order that our faith may be holy (and) pure, not relying upon itself
actively, but maintaining itself planted in him, do not say: "whence is the patience
to measure faith?", for each one is persuaded by the things he believes. if he
disbelieves them, then he would be unable to be persuaded. but it is a great thing for a
man who has faith, since he is not in unbelief, which is the world.
now the world is the place of unfaith and the place of death. and death
exists as ... (14 lines missing)... likeness and they will not believe. a holy thing is
the faith to see the likeness. the opposite is unfaith in the likeness. the things that he

imperishability [...] will become [...] loosen [...] those who were sent [...]. for he who
is distressed will not believe. he is unable to bring a great church, since it is gathered
out of a small gathering.
he became an emanation of the trace. for also they say about the
likeness that it is apprehended by means of his trace. the structure apprehends by means
of the likeness, but god apprehends by means of his members. he knew them before they were
begotten, and they will know him. and the one who begot each one from the first will
indwell them. he will rule over them. for it is necessary for each one ... (25 lines
missing)... the savior removed himself, since it is fitting. indeed, not ignorant but
carnal is the word who took him as a husband. and it is he who exists as an image, since
that one (masc.) also exists, as well as that one (fem.) who brought us forth. and she
caused him to know that she is the womb. this is a marvel of hers that she causes us to
transcend patience. but this is the marvel: he loves the one who was first to permit a
virgin [...]. it is fitting to [...] her [...] unto death [...] desire to practice ... (23
lines missing)therefore she yielded to him in her path. he was first to fix our eye upon
this virgin who is fixed to the cross that is in those places. and we see that it is her
water which the supreme authority granted to the one in whom there is a sign. this is the
water of immortality which the great powers will grant to him while he is below in the
likeness of her young son. she did not stop on his account. she [...] the [...] he became

and the shadow. behold [...] he [...] and this is the eternal reality before the souls
come forth from those who are being killed.
but he was being pursued in that place by the trace produced by the
savior. and he was crucified and he died - not his own death, for he did not at all
deserve to die because of the church of mortals. and he was nailed so that they might keep
him in the church. he answered her with humiliations, since in this way he had borne the
suffering which he had suffered. for jesus is for us a likeness on account of ... (14

us in nets of flesh. since the body is a temporary dwelling which the rulers and
authorities have as an abode, the man within, after being imprisoned in the fabrication,
fell into suffering. and having compelled him to serve them, they constrained him to serve
the energies. they split the church so as to inherit ... (9 lines missing)... power to

[...] be more to her [...] him. he ... (8 lines missing)... like [...] into [...] he has
them [...] them [...] each one will be worthy [...] take him and [...] the teacher should
hide himself as if he were a god who would embrace his works and destroy them. for he also
spoke with the church and he made himself her teacher of immortality, and destroyed the
arrogant teacher by teaching her to die.
and this teacher made a living school, for that teacher has another school: while it
teaches us about the dead writings, he, on the other hand, was causing us to remove
ourselves from the surfeit of the world; we were being taught about our death through
them.
now this is his teaching: do not call to a father upon the earth. your
father, who is in heaven, is one. you are the light of the world. they are my brothers and
my fellow companions who do the will of the father. for what use is it if you gain the
world and you forfeit your soul? for when we were in the dark, we used to call many
"father," since we were ignorant of the true father. and this is the great
conception of all the sins ... (8 lines missing)... pleasure. we are like [...] him to
[...] soul [...] men who [...] the dwelling place.
what now is the faith laid down by the master who released him from the great ignorance
and the darkness of the ignorant eye? he reminded him of the good things of his father and
the race. for he said to him, "now the world is not yours, may you not esteem the
form that is in it as advantageous; rather (as) disadvantageous and (as) a
punishment." receive now the teaching of the one who was reproached - an advantage
and a profit for the soul - and receive his shape. it is the shape that exists in the
presence of the father, the word and the height, that let you know him before you have
been led astray while in (the) flesh of condemnation.
likewise i became very small, so that through my humility i might take
you up to the great height, whence you had fallen. you were taken to this pit. if now you
believe in me, it is i who shall take you above, through this shape that you see. it is i
who shall bear you upon my shoulders. enter through the rib whence you came and hide
yourself from the beasts. the burden that you bear now is not yours. whenever you (fem.)
go ... (14 lines missing)... from his glory [...] from the first. from being counted with
the female, sleep brought labor and the sabbath, which is the world. for from being
counted with the father, sleep brought the sabbath and the exodus from the world of the
beasts. for the world is from beasts and it is a beast. therefore he that is lost has been
reckoned to the crafty one, and that one is from the beasts that came forth. they put upon
him a garment of condemnation, for the female had no other garment for clothing her seed
except the one she brought on the sabbath. for no beast exists in the aeon. for the father
does not keep the sabbath, but (rather) actuates the son, and through the son he continued
to provide himself with the aeons. the father has living rational elements from which he
puts on my members as garments. the man ... (11 lines missing)... this is the name. the
[...] he emitted himself and he emitted the reproached one. the one who was reproached
changed (his) name and, along with that which would be like the reproach, he appeared as
flesh. and the humiliated one has no equipment. he has no need of the glory that is not
his; he has his own glory with the name, which is the son. now he came that we might
become glorious through the humiliated one that dwells in the places of humiliation. and
through him who was reproached we receive the forgiveness of sins. and through the one who
was reproached and the one who was redeemed we receive grace.
but who is it that redeemed the one who was reproached? it is the
emanation of the name. for just as the flesh has need of a name, so also is the flesh an
aeon that wisdom has emitted. it received the majesty that is descending, so that the aeon
might enter the one who was reproached, that we might escape the disgrace of the carcass
and be regenerated in the flesh and blood of ... (8 lines missing)... destiny. he [...]
and the aeons [...] they accepted the son although he was a complete mystery [...] each
one of his members [...] grace. when he cried out, he was separated from the church like
portions of the darkness from the mother, while his feet provided him traces, and these
scorched the path of the ascent to the father.
but what is the way and manner (in) which it (fem.) became their head?
well, it (fem.) made the dwelling place to bring forth the light to those who dwell within
him, so that they might see the ascending church. for the head drew itself up from the
pit; it was bent over the cross and it looked down to tartaros so that those below might
look above. hence, for example, when someone looks at someone, then the face of the one
who looked down looks up; so also once the head looked from the height to its members, our
members went above, where the head was. and it, the cross, was undergoing nailing for the
members, and solely that they might be able ... (7 lines missing)... have [...] because
they were like [...] slave. the consummation is thus: he whom she indicated will be
completed by the one who indicated. and the seeds that remain will endure until the all is
separated and takes shape.
and thus the decree will be fulfilled, for just as the woman who is honored until death
has the advantage of time, so too will it give birth. and this offspring will receive the
body appointed for it, and it will become perfect. he has a generous nature, since the son
of god dwells in him. and whenever he acquires the all, whatever he possesses will <be
dissolved> in the fire because it greatly despised and outraged the father.
moreover, when the great son was sent after his small brothers, he
spread abroad the edict of the father and proclaimed it, opposing the all. and he removed
the old bond of debt, the one of condemnation. and this is the edict that was: those who
made themselves enslaved have become condemned in adam. they have been brought from death,
received forgiveness for their sins, and been redeemed by ... (9 lines missing)... since
we are worthy [...] and [...] but i say [...] and these [...]. for [...] is worthy to
[...] god. and the father [...] the christ removed himself from all these, since he loves
his members with all his heart. one who is jealous sets his members against one another.
if he is not jealous, he will not be removed from (the) other members and the good which
he sees.
by having a brother who regards us as he also is, one glorifies the one
who gives us grace. moreover, it is fitting for each of us to enjoy the gift that he has
received from god, and that we not be jealous, since we know that he who is jealous is an
obstacle in his (own) path, since he destroys only himself with the gift and he is
ignorant of god. he ought to rejoice and be glad and partake of grace and bounty. does
someone have a prophetic gift? share it without hesitation. neither approach your brother
jealously nor ... (8 lines missing)... chosen as they [...] empty as they escape [...]
fallen from their [...] are ignorant that [...] in this way they have [...] them in [...]
in order that they may reflect perforce upon the things that you want them to think about
when they think about you. now your brother also has his grace: do not belittle yourself,
but rejoice and give thanks spiritually, and pray for that one, in order that you might
share the grace that dwells within him. so do not consider him foreign to you, rather,
(as) one who is yours, whom each of your <fellow> members received. by loving the
head who possesses them, you also possess the one from whom it is that these outpourings
of gifts exist among your brethren.
but is someone making progress in the word? do not be hindered by this;
do not say: ''why does he speak while i do not?", for what he says is (also) yours,
and that which discerns the word and that which speaks is the same power. the word ... (13
lines missing)... eye or a hand only, although they are a single body. those who belong to
us all serve the head together. and each one of the members reckons it as a member. they
cannot all become entirely a foot or entirely an eye or entirely a hand, since these
members will not live alone; rather they are dead. we know that they are being put to
death. so why do you love the members that are still dead, instead of those that live? how
do you know that someone is ignorant of the brethren? for you are ignorant when you hate
them and are jealous of them, since you will not receive the grace that dwells within
them, being unwilling to reconcile them to the bounty of the head. you ought to give
thanks for our members and ask that you too might be granted the grace that has been given
to them. for the word is rich, generous and kind. here he gives away gifts to his men
without jealousy, according to ... (11 lines missing)... appeared in each of the members
[...] himself [...] since they do not fight at all with one another on account of their
difference(s). rather, by laboring with one another, they will work with one another, and
if one of them suffers, they will suffer with him, and when each one is saved, they are
saved together.
moreover, if they would wait for the exodus from the (earthly) harmony, they will come
to the aeon. if they are fit to share in the (true) harmony, how much the more those who
derive from the single unity? they ought to be reconciled with one another. do not accuse
your head because it has not appointed you as an eye but rather as a finger. and do not be
jealous of that which has been put in the class of an eye or a hand or a foot, but be
thankful that you do not exist outside the body. on the contrary, you have the same head
on whose account the eye exists, as well as the hand and the foot and the rest of the
parts. why do you despise the one that is appointed as [...] it desired to [...] you
slandered [...] does not embrace [...] unmixed body [...] chosen [...] dissolve [...] of

place. some exist in the visible church - those who exist in the church of men - and
unanimously they proclaim to one another the pleroma of their aeon. and some exist for
death in the church on whose behalf they go - she for whom they are death - while others
are for life. therefore they are lovers of abundant life. and each of the rest endures by
his own root. he puts forth fruit that is like him, since the roots have a connection with
one another and their fruits are undivided, the best of each. they possess them, existing
for them and for one another. so let us become like the roots, since we are equal [...]
