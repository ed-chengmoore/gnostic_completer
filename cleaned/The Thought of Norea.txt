father of all, ennoia of the light, dwelling in the heights above the (regions) below,
light dwelling in the heights, voice of truth, upright nous, untouchable logos, and
ineffable voice, incomprehensible father!
it is norea who cries out to them. they heard, (and) they received her into her place
forever. they gave it to her in the father of nous, adamas, as well as the voice of the
holy ones, in order that she might rest in the ineffable epinoia, in order that
<she> might inherit the first mind which <she> had received, and that
<she> might rest in the divine autogenes, and that she (too) might generate herself,
just as she also has inherited the living logos, and that she might be joined to all of
the imperishable ones, and speak with the mind of the father.
and she began to speak with the words of life, and <she> remained in the presence
of the exalted one, possessing that which she had received before the world came into
being. she has the great mind of the invisible one, and she gives glory to <her>
father, and she dwells within those who [...] within the pleroma, and she beholds the
pleroma.
there will be days when she will behold the pleroma, and she will not be in deficiency,
for she has the four holy helpers who intercede on her behalf with the father of the all,
adamas. he it is who is within all of the adams, possessing the thought of norea, who
speaks concerning the two names which create a single name.
