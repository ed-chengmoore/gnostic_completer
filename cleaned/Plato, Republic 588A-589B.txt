things that were said to us. and we will find that he says, 'good is he who has been done
injustice completely. he is glorified justly.' is not this how he was reproached?"

who told them [...] ruler, these now have become natural creatures - even chimaera and
cerberus and all the rest that were mentioned. they all came down and they cast off forms
and images. and they all became a single image. it was said, 'work now!' certainly it is a
single image that became the image of a complex beast with many heads. some days indeed it
is like the image of a wild beast. then it is able to cast off the first image. and all
these hard and difficult forms emanate from it with effort, since these are formed now
with arrogance. and also all the rest that are like them are formed now through the word.

profitable for him is this: that he cast down every image of the evil beast and trample
them along with the images of the lion. but the man is in weakness in this regard. and all

time with them. [...]. and he [...] to him in[...]. but he brings about [...] enmity

said to everyone who praises the doing of injustice."
"then is it not profitable for him who speaks justly?"
"and if he does these things and speaks in them, within the man they take hold
firmly. therefore especially he strives to take care of them and he nourishes them just
like the farmer nourishes his produce daily. and the wild beasts keep it from growing.
