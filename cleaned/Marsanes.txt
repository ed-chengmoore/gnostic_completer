marsanes' vision of the nature,
structure, and deployment of the entirety


a. the thirteen seals
but as for the thirteenth 13 seal, i have confirmed it 14
together with [the] limit of 15 knowledge and the certainty
16 of rest.


1. seals 1-3 the corporeal: the worldly and material
levels

the first 17 [and the] second and the 18 [third]
are for the worldly 19 and the material. i have 20
[informed] you concerning these, that you should 21 [guard]
your bodies. and 22 a sense-perceptible [power] 23
will [hide] those who will rest, 24 and they will be kept 25
[from the] passion(s) and division 26 [of the] (incarnational)
union.

2. seals 4-5 the incorporeal: the sojourn (seal
4) and repentance (seal 5)

the fourth (the sojourn) 27 [and the] fifth (the repentance)
which is above (it, i.e., the sojourn), 28 [are the ones] you
have come to know 29 [as divine]. 30 [the fourth,
concerning that which] 3 1 exists after (i.e., above)
the [somatic type] 2 and nature, 3 that is, that
which [is divided in] 4 three. and you [were] 5 [informed]
about [these and that which is] 6 in three [dimensions] 7
by these [two (the fourth & fifth?)]. 8 you [were informed
that it] 9 is incorporeal 10 [...] 11
and after [...] 12 within [...] 13 every [...] which
[... and] 14 the things within them.

3. seal 5 the repentance

the [fifth,] 15 [concerning the] repentance [of] 16
those that are within me and 17 {concerning those} who sojourn
in that place (the fourth?). 18

4. seal 6 the self-generated ones

but the sixth, 19 concerning the self-generated ones, 20
concerning the incorporeal being 21 that exists individually
(cf. the perfect individuals), 22 together with those who abide
in 23 the truth of the all [in regard to] 24 understanding
and 25 assurance (or: stability).

5. seal 7 the autogenes

and the [seventh,] 26 concerning the self-begotten power 27
which [is the] 28 third [perfect mind, 29 [the
second (after barbelo) who extended to] 4 1 [the] fourth
(the sojourn) for salvation 2 [through] wisdom.

6. seal 8 the protophanes

and the eighth, 3 concerning the mind which is 4
[male, which] appeared 5 [in the beginning (i.e., "protophanes")],
as well as the substance 6 [which is incorporeal] and the 7
[intelligible] world.

7. seal 9 the kalyptos

the ninth, 8 [concerning the head] of the power 9
[that] appeared [in the] 10 [beginning.

8. seal 10 the aeon of barbelo

the] tenth, [concerning] 11 [barbelo, the] virgin 12
[who is male], that is, the aeon.13

9. seals 11-12 the triple powered one and the invisible
spirit

[the eleventh] and [the] 14 [twelfth] speak of the 15
invisible one who possesses 16 three powers 17 and
the insubstantial spirit 18 who belongs to 19 the
first unbegotten one (fem., i.e., first unbegotten power of the triple
powered one, which is the invisible spirit).

10. seal 13 the unknown silent one


the 20 thirteenth speaks concerning 21 [the] silent
one who was not 22 [known], even the foundation (katarchê
= ) of 23 the indiscriminables. 24


b. marsanes' insight into the nature of incorporeal
and corporeal reality
for it is i who have 25 [contemplated] that which truly exists.
26 [whether] individually or 27 [as a whole], by
difference 28 [i knew] that they [pre]-exist 29 [in
the] entire place (i. e., the aeonic realm) that is 5 1
eternal: all those that have come into 2 existence whether without
substance 3 or with substance, those who are 4 unbegotten,
and the divine aeons 5 together with the angels and the 6
souls without guile 7 and the soul-[garments], 8
the images of [the] 9 simple ones (souls?). and [afterwards
they] 10 were mixed with [those that were distinct from] 11
them (i.e., their bodies?). but [even the] 12 entire [perceptible]
substance 13 still resembles the [intelligible
substance] 14 as well as the insubstantial. [i have known] 15
the entire corruption [of the former (the perceptible realm)] 16
as well as the immortality of 17 the latter (fem., i.e., the
intelligible and insubstantial).
i have discriminated 18 and have attained
the boundary of the sense-perceptible 19 world (and) 20
the entire realm 21 of the incorporeal
essence. and 22 the intelligible world knew 23 by
discrimination 24 that in every respect the sense-perceptible
25 world is [worthy] 26 of being preserved entire,
[for] 27 i have not ceased speaking [of the] 28 autogenes,
[lest] 29 [anyone] be [ignorant] 6 1 in turn
of the entire place (i.e., the aeonic realm). 2


c. the saving descent of autogenes
he (autogenes) descended, again he descended 3 from the unbegotten
one 4 who is insubstantial, who 5 is the spirit.
the one (autogenes??) who exists 6 before all of them (the realms
below the barbelo aeon) extends 7 [to the divine] self-generated
ones. 8 the one who is 9 [substantial (autogenes)]
examines 10 [the all (the barbelo aeon)] and is 11
[the all and] resembles 12 [the all]. and from 13
[the single one] they [are] divided, 14 [so that] i experienced
15 many things, it being manifest 16 that he saved
a multitude. 17


d. the deployment of the barbelo aeon from the
triple powered one

1. marsanes inquires about the aeonic realm of
the triple powered one

but beyond all of these, 18 i am seeking the kingdom 19
of the triple powered one, 20 which has no beginning. whence
21 did he appear and 22 act to fill the 23 the
entire place (i. e., the aeonic realm) with his power? and 24
in what way did the unbegotten ones 25 come into existence without
being begotten? and 26 what are [the] differences among the
[aeons]? 27 [and] as for those who are unbegotten, 28
how many [are they]? and in what respect 29 [do they differ]
from each other?


2. the triple powered one actualizes the silence
of the unknown silent one

7 1 when i had inquired about these things 2
i perceived that he (the triple powered one) acted 3 from silence.
he exists 4 prior to those that 5 truly exist, that
belong to the realm of being. 6 he (the triple powered one)
is a pre-existent otherness 7 belonging to the one (the invisible
spirit) that 8 actualizes the silent one. 9 and the
silence of [that (the triple powered one) which follows] 10
him (the invisible spirit) acts. for [so] 11 [long as] the latter
(the spirit) [acts], 12 the former (the triple powered one)
[acts also]. 13 the [silence which belongs to the un-] 14
begotten one (the invisible spirit) is among [the aeons, and from] 15
the beginning he is in-[substantial]. 16 but the activity of
17 that one (the invisible spirit) <is> the triple powered
one. 18 the unbegotten one (the invisible spirit) is prior to
19 the aeon, since he is in-[substantial]. 20
and as for the summit of the 21 silence of the silent one,
22 it is possible <for> the summit (i.e., the invisible spirit)
23 of the energy of the triple 24 powered one to
behold it. and the one (the unknown silent one) who 25 exists,
who is silent, [who is] 26 beyond [insubstantiality], 27
manifested [the triple] 28 [powered, first-] 29 perfect
one.

3. the self-manifestation of the triple powered
one

[when he appeared] 8 1 to the powers, they rejoiced.
2 those that are within me were completed 3 together
with all the 4 rest. and they all blessed 5 the triple
powered one, 6 one by one, who 7 is [the] first-perfect
one, 8 [blessing] him in purity, [every]where 9 praising
the lord 10 [who exists] before the all, 11 [who
(is) the] triple powered one. 12 [it did not happen that] their
worshippings 13 [were audible], but [it was my part] 14
[to keep on] 15 [inquiring] how they had 16 become
silent. i would contemplate a 17 power that i hold 18 in
honor.

4. the barbelo aeon reveals itself as the triple
powered one's third power

when the third 19 power (i.e. the barbelo aeon) of the triple
powered one 20 contemplated him (the triple powered one), 21
it said to me (marsanes), "be silent 22 lest you should know
and flee 23 and come before me. but 24 know that
this one was 25 [silent], and concentrate on understanding.
26 for [the power still] keeps 27 [guiding] me into
28 [the aeon which] is barbelo, 29 [the] male [virgin]."


5. marsanes explains the barbelo aeon's deployment
from the invisible spirit

9 1 for this reason the 2 virgin became male
(as nous, the aeon of barbelo), 3 because she had separated
from the male (i.e., the invisible spirit). the 4 knowledge
stood outside of him, 5 as if belonging to him. 6
and she who exists is she who sought. 7 she is situated just
as 8 the triple powered one is situated. 9 she withdrew
10 from [these] two [powers] (the first two powers of the triple
powered one), 11 since she exists [outside of] 12 the
great one (the invisible spirit), [seeing what] 13 is above
[her, the perfect one (the triple powered one)] 14 who is silent,
[who has] 15 this [commandment] 16 to be silent.
his knowledge (gnôsis; cf. mind) 17 and his hypostasis
(hypostasis;  cf. existence) 18 and his activity
(energeia;  cf. life) 19 are those things that the
power (dynamis, i.e. barbelo) 20 of the triple powered
one expressed: 21


6. the barbelo aeon describes the praise of the
triple powered one

"we all have 22 withdrawn to ourselves. we have [become] 23
silent, [and] 24 when we [too] came to know [that he is] 25
the triple powered one, [we] 26 bowed down; we [gave glory and
we] 27 blessed him. [he conferred] 28 upon us [a
great revelation]." 29
[again] the invisible [spirit] 10 1
ran up 2 to his place. the entire place (i. e., the aeonic realm)
3 was revealed, the entire place unfolded 4 <until>
he reached the upper region. 5 again he went forth and caused
the 6 entire place to be illuminated, and the entire 7
place was illuminated.



e. marsanes receives the power of the barbelo aeon
and [i (marsanes)] have been given 8 the third part (i.e., knowledge,
the barbelo aeon) of 9 [the spirit] of the power of the triple
10 [powered] 11 [one]! blessed is 12 [the
aeon (of barbelo)]! it (the power) said:


f. through marsanes the barbelo aeon urges the
ascent towards the invisible spirit
"o 13 [inhabitants of these] places (the sensible world?)! it
is necessary 14 [for you (sg.) to contemplate] those that are
higher 15 than these (the denizens of the barbelo aeon?), and
tell them to the 16 powers. for you will become 17 [better]
than the elect 18 [in the last] times. 19 upward
mounts the invisible spirit! 20 and you (pl.) 21
[yourselves], ascend with him 22 [up above], since you have
23 [the] great [radiant] crown! 24 but on that day
25 you will see 26 [as you hasten to] ascend above
27 [with him]. and [even] the sense-perceptible 28
[things that are] visible 29 [to you ...] and they ..." (pages

g. marsanes' ascent to the triple powered one
i [was dwelling] 16 among the aeons that were 17
generated. as i was permitted, [i] 18 came to be among those
that were un-[begotten]. 19 but i was dwelling in the [great]
20 aeon (of barbelo), although i [was separate from it]. 21
and [i saw] 22 [the] three powers [of] 23 the
triple [powered] one. 24 the [first (third?)] 25 [power
...] 26 and [...] 27 [...] 28 [...] 29
[...] 15 1 [... the] silent one and the 2
triple powered one, [and the one (i.e., the spirit)] 3 that
does not have breath. 4
we took our stand [...] 5 [...] we [contemplated]

[...] 19 [...] 20 [...] 21 [...] 22
[...] 23 [...] 24 [...] 25 [...] 26
[...] 27 [...] 28 [...] 29 [... the spirit]
16 1 [that] does not have breath, 2 [and he]
exists in [unknowability]. 3


h. marsanes sees the supreme deity
and [through] him (the invisible spirit?) i saw 4 the great
5 [unknowable power (the unknown silent one?)]. 6 [...]
7 [...] 8 [...] 9 [...] 10
[...] 11 [...] 12 [the one without] limit [...] 13
[...] and [i] 14 [saw the one who exists] alone 15

but it is necessary that 17 [that everyone
who] is without image 18 [be like] those of the [single] one

[...] 6 [...] 7 [...] 8 [...] thirty

[...] 13 [... herself]. 14


the nomenclature of the cosmic
powers and of the soul

a. the need to know the nomenclature of the cosmic
powers and of the soul
and [again after] 15 many [years, as for me], 16
when i saw the [father (?) i came to] 17 know him, and [...]
18 many [...] 19 partial [...] 20 for
ever [...] 21 the material ones [...] 22 worldly
[...] 23 above [...] 24 in addition [...] 25
[...] 26 [...] 27 [...] 28 [...] 29
[...] 19 1 [...] 2 [...] 3 [...]
4 [...] 5 [...] 6 [...] 7 [...]
8 [...] 9 [...] 10 [...] 11
[...] 12 [...] 13 [...] he [...] 14 [...]
... [it is necessary that] a deity [transfer them] 15 from [those
who] 16 [observe] the things that 17 [act in] them
into 18 [actuality]. name 19 [them according] to
their nomenclature, 20 [and let no] one [think] 21
[that you (pl.) are] inferior to [their] 22 [knowledge] and
their [hypostasis]. 23 and [in addition, so that] 24
[...] 25 [...] 26 [...] 27 [...] 28

3 [...] 4 [...] 5 [...] 6 [...]
7 [...] 8 [...] 9 [...] 10
[...] 11 [...] 12 [...] 13 [...] 14
[...] hidden [...] 15 [... the] third 16 [power].


b. the blessed authority's instructions on preparing
the soul
[and] the blessed authority (chief fem.) 17 said [to me]: 18
"among these [may] 19 she who [does not have it receive no glory].
20 for there is no glory [...] 21 nor even the one
(masc.) who [...] 22 for indeed the one [without glory] 23
[is] a ... [...]. 24 for [...] 25 [...] 26
[...] 27 [...] 28 [...] 29 [...]


c. the configurations and powers of the zodiacal
signs
21 1 [...] 2 [...] 3 [...] 4
[...] 5 [...] 6 [...] 7 [...] 8
[...] 9 [...] 10 [...] 11 [...]
12 [...] 13 [...] 14 [...] and the [zodiacal
signs] 15 [...] and the [...] 16 [...] and [...]
17 [...] which do not have [...] 18 [...] acquire
for [...] 19 [...] revolution 20 [...] and [it is
the] soul [that] 21 [has] the this [sort of] 22 [corporeality],
namely 23 [the] celestial soul [that] 24 [sur]rounds
[the world]. 25 [...] configuration [...] 26 [...]
which is [...] 27 [...] 28 [...] 29 [...]
22 1 [...] 2 [...] 3 [...] 4
[...] 5 [...] 6 [...] 7 [...] 8
[...] 9 [...] 10 [...] 11 [...]
12 [...] 13 [...] 14 [spiritual ...] ...
[...] 15 [... and] those that [have likeness] 16
[...] 17 [...]... those who [...] 18 [... the form
...] 19 [...] all the images [of which i] 20 [spoke].
[it is necessary that] 21 all the forms [become] 22
configurations, so that [the forms may] 23 become [the elements
(cf. letters)] 24 themselves [including the] 15 [smooth
(cf. inaspirates)] and the [rough (cf. aspirates), like] 26
[the voices] of animals [...] 27 [...] and the [...] 28
[...] 29 [...] (pages 23-24 missing) 25 1
[...] there.
but their (the signs of the zodiac) 2 powers,
which are the angels, 3 are in the form of 4 beasts
and animals. 5 some among them are 6 [polymorphous]
and contrary to 7 [nature]; they have [sounds] 8 for
(adapted to?) their names, that [is], 9 they are [distinct]
and [different] 10 in [appearance] 11 and [they are
bi-] 12 [formed]. but these that are 13 [homo-] phonic
by a third 14 originate from substance. 15
and concerning these, all of 16 these
(remarks) are sufficient, 17 since we have (already) spoken
about them. for [this] 18 distribution takes
place 19 again in these regions (i.e., here) in [the manner]
20 we have mentioned from the [beginning]. 21

d. the alphabet and the configurations of the soul

1. vowels and diphthongs: the first and second
configurations of the soul

however, the soul 22 too [has] 23 its configuration,
although it is diverse. 24 it is [in] 25 [its] form
26 that the configuration of the only begotten soul 27
resides. its configuration 28 is [the second] 26 1
spherical part--eêiou-- 2 while the first
goes around [it], 3 the self-begotten soul-- 4 aeêiouô.
5
[the] second configuration-- 6 eêiou--derives
from those [having] 7 two sounds (diphthongs). the first 8
that suffixes them is [the] 9 [upsilon], and [the iota
is its] 10 [companion. and these are the ones] 11
[you know] in [the radiance] 12 of the light.
[control] 13 yourselves, receive [the]
14 imperishable seed, 15 bear fruit, and 16
do not be 17 attached to your possessions. 18

2. tones/accents

but know that the oxytones (jise = oxys; or should it be "long vowels"
= makra = êô) 19 exist among the vowels 20
and the 21 diphthongs 22 beside them. but the [short
(vowels) (brachy eo; or should this be barytones = baru =
gajb?)] 23 are deficient, as well as the 24
[other sounds that] originate 25 through them. [and] those that
[are drawn (~perispwmenon i.e., circumflex)], 26 since
they are intermediate, 27 [are also deficient].

3. consonants and their combinations

the sounds of 28 [the semivowels (hemiphwna = z x
y l m n r s)] are 27 1 superior to the voiceless
(consonants b g d k p t th ph c = aphôna). 2 and
those that are double (z x ps = dipla) are superior 3
to the semivowels which 4 do not change (lmnr =ametabola).
and the aspirates (dasu = th ph xi) 5 are better
than the inaspirates (psila = k p t) <of> 6 the mute
consonants (b g d k p t th ph xi). 7 and as for those
that are intermediate (b g d = mesa), 8 their
combinations are many (e.g., by aspirate or "spiritual" precedence = ph
b p - xi g k - th d t). 9 they are ignorant [of] 10
the good ones (i.e., combinations) and 11 are combined with
the worse ones in the [middle]. 12
[as] in the case 13 of the nomenclature
for the [gods] 14 and the angels, it is [not that] 15
they (the consonants) are combined with each other 16 indiscriminately,
but 17 only that they have 8 a beneficial effect.
19 it just didn't happen 20 that their intention
(or: pronunciation) was apparent. 21
don't (sg.) [sin anymore], 22 and don't
dare to 23 have anything to do with sin.
now [i] 24 speak to you (sg.) [concerning
the] 25 [three configurations of the form] 26 of
the soul.

4. vowels and the second and third configurations
of the soul

[the] 27 third [configuration of the soul] 28 is
[a sphere and] 28 1 it is a spherical one that goes around
2 it. from the 3 simple vowels 4 <aaa,>
eee, <êêê,> iii, ooo,
uuu, ôôô 5 the diphthongs were
6 as follows: ai, au, 7 [e]i, eu,
êu, ou, ôu, oi, hi, 8 [u]i, ôi.
auei, euêu, oiou, 9 [gg]g, ggg, ggg,
aiau, 10 [eieu], êu, oiou, ôu,
ggg, 11 [ggg], aueieu, oiou, êu-- 12
three times for a male soul. 13 the third 14 configuration
is spherical; 15 the second configuration, 16 since
it goes around it, has 17 two sounds (is a diphthong).
the male soul's 18 third configuration
19 (consists) of the 20 simple vowels: 21
aaa, eee, êêê, iii, ooo, 22 uuu,
ôôô, ôôô, ôôô.
23 [and] this configuration is distinct 24 [from]
the first, but 25 [they resemble] each other 26 [and
they] make some 27 [easy sounds] of 28 [this sort:
aeê]oô (i.e., the protactic vowels of the diphthongs).
and 29 1 from these (are made) the diphthongs (by appending
i or u). 2

5. vowel combinations and the fourth and fifth configurations of the soul

so also the 3 fourth and the fifth: 4 with regard
to them, not everything was allowed to be 5 revealed, 6 but only those things that are
obvious. 7 you (pl.) were taught 8 about them, that
you should contemplate them 9 in order that they, too, might
10 seek and find [what] 11 they all are, either 12
through themselves alone 13 or through one another, 14
or (seek) to reveal [limits] 15 set from the beginning, 16
either with reference to themselves alone [or] 17 with reference
to one another.
just as [they (the letters)] 18 coexist
with each other [in] 19 speech, whether individually 20
or by similarity, [they are] 21 prepended (or) [they] 22
are appended. either their 23 [part] is derivative and 24
similar, whether through [the] 25 [long (makron)] (vowels
êô) or [through] 26 those of [dual time value
(dichronoi aiu), or] 27 through [the short (vowels
brachy eo)] 28 which are short [...] 29
[...] 30 1 or the oxytones (or: short vowels) or the 2 intermediate
tones (i.e., perispômena) or the barytones (or: short vowels). 3

6. consonant-vowel combinations: syllables

and (sometimes) <the> consonants 4 exist with the vowels, 5 and
by turns 6 they are prepended 7 and appended. 8
they constitute a nomenclature 9 [for] the angels. and (sometimes)
10 [the] consonants are 11 independent (self-existent?),
12 [and] diverse-- 13 they (txt. "it": sg. vb w.
neut. pl. subject?) prefix and they (txt. "it") suffix 14 the
hidden 15 gods (the graphically unrepresented phenomena of speech?).
by means of 16 beat and 17 pitch and 18
silence and attack 19 [they] summon the semivowels, 20
all of which 21 are subjected to a 22 single [sound].
just as it is only 13 the [unchanging (consonants l m n r
s)] <and> the double (consonants z ch ps) 24 that
exist among the semivowels (z ch ps l m n r s), 25 the
aspirates (dasy th ph xi) 26 [and the inaspirates
(psiloi k p t)] and the 27 [intermediates (b
g d)] constitute 28 [the voiceless (consonants [mute b
g d k p t th ph xi]).
contrary to] 29 [nature they (the consonants and vowels)]
are combined 30 [with one another, and] they are separate 31
1 from one another. they are 2 prepended and appended,
3 and they constitute an 4 ignorant nomenclature.
5 and they (the resulting syllables) become one or 6 two
or three or [four] 7 or five or six up to 8 seven
having a 9 [simple] sound. these that [have] 10 two
[sounds (diphthongs)] are grouped with [the] 11 [seventeen consonants.
among] 12 the previously named (~proônumos)
[some] are 13 deficient and 14 they are as if [they]
had no substance, 15 or as if [they] were an image [of] 16
substance, [or] as if they separate 17 the nature [that is]
good [from the one] 18 that [is evil] in the [middle.] 19
and you (sg.) [will assemble] 20 into those (patterns) that
resemble each other 21 the vowels [together with] 22
the consonants. some 23 are: bagad[a]zatha,
24 beged[e]zeqe, [bêgêdê]
25 zêthê, [bigidizithi, bogo]
26 dozotho, [buguduzuthu], 27 bôgôdô[zôthô,
and] 28 the rest. [and some are]: 29 ba[bebêbibobubô].
32 1 but the rest are 2 different: abebêbi
3 [b]ob, in order that you (sg.) might [assemble]
4 them and become separate from the 5 angels.

7. arithmology

and there 6 will be some effects. 7 a good point of departure
8 is from 9 [the] triad. it [extends] 10
[to that which (i.e., the dyad)] has need of [the one] 11 [that] confined
12 [it in] a shape (the triad).
<the> dyad 13 and the monad 14 do not resemble
anything; rather 15 they are principles. 16 the dyad
[constitutes] 17 a division [from the] monad, [and] 18
[it] belongs to the hypostasis (should this be substrate = hypokeimenon?).
19 but the tetrad received (the) [elements] 20 and
the pentad 21 received concord, and the 22 [hexad]
was perfected by 23 itself. the 24 [hebdomad] received
beauty, 25 [and the] ogdoad 26 [attuned its constituents]
27 [to harmony], 28 [and the ennead is] 29
[honored much more]. 33 1 and the [decad revealed]
2 the entire place (i. e., the aeonic realm). 3 but
the hendecad and the 4 [dodecad] have passed over 5 [into
the boundless], 6 [and] it [is higher than] the 7 hebdomad
[which is] 8 [bounded. ...] 9 [...] 10

8. syllables and nouns

[...] 11 [...] 12 from [...] 13 [...]
14 [...] 15 [noun(s) ...] 16 [...] 17
promise that [the articulation marks (diairesis)] 18 begin [to
separate] 19 them by means of 20 a sign [and] 21
a point, the [uninflected (upright = :) one] 22 and the [inflected
(bent = klje)] one. 23 so also [are the images]
24 of being: 25 they derive [from a joining] 26
of the letters (elements) 27 in [a holy union] 34 1
according to a [juxtaposition] 2 where they exist independently.
3 [and] <they> exist with each 4 [other] by generation
or [by] 5 [their kinship]. and] according to
[their own] 6 [generation] they do not have 7 [...]
these [...] 8 [...] 9 [...] 10 [...] 11
[...] 12 [...] 13 [...] 14 [...] 15
[...] 16 [... they have] 17 [...] 18 [...]
one [...] speaking 19 [the] riddle. just as within 20
[the] sense-perceptible world 21 there exists the temple 22
[which measures] seven hundred 23 [cubits], and a river which
24 [...] within 25 [an] eternity, they 26
[...] three 27 [...] to the four 28 [...] seal(s)
29 [...] clouds 35 1 [and the] waters, and
the [forms] 2 [of the] wax images, 3 [and] some emerald
images. 4
for the rest, i will 5 [teach you (sg.)]
about them. this is 6 [the] generation of the names. that (fem.)
which [was not] 7 generated [... from the] 8 beginning
[...] 9 [...] 10 [...] 11 [...] 12
[...] 13 [...] 14 [...] 15 with regard
to [...] 16 [...] 17 however, [... three] 18
times, when [closed], when 19 lengthened, when [short]. 20

9. words

but there exists gentle [discourse] 21 and there exists
another 22 discourse [related to] 23 [permanent (ahe
for rmhe?)] substance 24 of this [sort, by speaking]
25 of [that which is invisible], 26 and it [manifests]
27 the difference [between the same] 28 and the [different
and] 36 1 between the whole and a [part] 2 of
an [indivisible] substance. 3 and [that] power 4 has
[a] 5 share in [the joy]-- 6 in (both) discord and
[harmony--] 7 [of their honor], whether 8 [...] 9
[...] 10 [...] 11 [...] 12 [...]
13 [...] 14 [...] 15 [... it is] possible
16 [to know that the things that] exist 17 everywhere
[are honored] 18 always, 19 [since they] dwell (both)
with the corporeal 20 and the incorporeal ones. 21
this is the discourse on the hypostases 22 that one should 23
[know] in this way. if 24 [they do] not [speak] with one another,
25 [how then] does it (the discourse) help 26 [those
who] are troubled [with] 27 [it (the discourse) about that which is] visible?
28 [therefore] if one 37 1 knows it, one will
2 [speak] it. 3
but there are words, some 4 of which are [dual], 5
[and others] that exist 6 [separately, the ones that pertain]
7 to [substance (proper nouns?) ...]
8 [...] 9 [...]
10 [...] 11 [...] 12 [...] 13
[and] they [...] 14 ... [...] 15 or those which [...]
16 [... according to those that perdure] 17 or according
to [those that] have 18 time . and [these] 19 either
are separated 20 or they are joined with one another 21
or with themselves, either [the] 22 diphthongs, or the 23
simple [vowels], or every [...] 24 or [...] 25 or
[...] 26 [exist] just as [...] 27 [exist] ... [...]
28 the [consonants ...] 38 1 they exist individually
2 until they are divided 3 and joined.
now some 4 are able 5 [to
generate the consonants] 6 [letter] by [letter] ...] 7
[... difference] 8 [...] 9 [...] 10
[...] 11 [...] 12 [...] become 13 [...
being]... 14 [.... ] 15 [they (the letters) will
count] once 16 [or twice], and thrice 17
[for the] vowels, 18 and twice 19 [for] the consonants,
20 [and] once for 21 the entire ensemble, and with 22 uncertainty for 23 [things
that] are subject to change 24 [as well as those things that] originated 25 [from them] and [everything] 26 thereafter. and 27 they are all [the names] 28
[at once. they] were 39 1 hidden, but they were pronounced
2 openly. they did not 3 stop being revealed, 4
nor did they stop 5 naming the angels. 6 the
vowels [are joined with] the 8 [consonants, whether] externally
9 [or] internally, 10 by means of [...] they 11
said [...] 12 [teach you ...] 13 again [in this way
they were counted] 14 four times, (and) they were [engendered]
15 three 16 times, and they became 17
[twelvefold]. 18



being worthy of and safeguarding
the revelation
for these reasons we have acquired 19 sufficiency; for it is
fitting that 20 each one acquire 21 power for himself
that he may bear fruit, 22 and that we 23 never heap
24 scorn [on] the mysteries 25 [...] the [...] 26
for [...] which [is ...] 27 [... the] souls [...] 28
[... the] signs of the zodiac [...] 29 [...] 30 [...]
40 1 a new hypostasis. 2 and the reward which
will 3 be provided for such a one 4 is salvation.
5 but the opposite will 6 happen there to the one
7 who commits sin. [the one who commits] sin 8 by
himself [...] will be 9 [in a ... in a] 10 [...]
11 [... these]. 12
[ponder them] so that, 13 before you (sg.) examine
14 what one 15 might [convey] to another, 16
[you may receive an] exalted power 17 and a divine knowledge 18
and an ability that 19 cannot be resisted. 20 but
you (sg.) shall examine 21 who is worthy that he should 22
reveal them, knowing 23 that they [will ... down] 24

[divulging] them to [any] one. 8 [...] ... 9 [...]
10 [...] 11 [...] lest [he succeed] 12
[in understanding them] and take [them away]. 13 [and, as for
the remainder], 14 i [will speak to] them of the [completion]
15 [of my discourse] lest 16 the sinful person 17
[divulge them to others]. 18 they did not understand them, namely
the embodied 19 souls upon 20 the earth, as well
as those outside of 21 the body, who are in heaven, 22

marsanes' vision of the nature,
structure, and deployment of the entirety


a. the thirteen seals
but as for the thirteenth 13 seal, i have confirmed it 14
together with [the] limit of 15 knowledge and the certainty
16 of rest.


1. seals 1-3 the corporeal: the worldly and material
levels

the first 17 [and the] second and the 18 [third]
are for the worldly 19 and the material. i have 20
[informed] you concerning these, that you should 21 [guard]
your bodies. and 22 a sense-perceptible [power] 23
will [hide] those who will rest, 24 and they will be kept 25
[from the] passion(s) and division 26 [of the] (incarnational)
union.

2. seals 4-5 the incorporeal: the sojourn (seal
4) and repentance (seal 5)

the fourth (the sojourn) 27 [and the] fifth (the repentance)
which is above (it, i.e., the sojourn), 28 [are the ones] you
have come to know 29 [as divine]. 30 [the fourth,
concerning that which] 3 1 exists after (i.e., above)
the [somatic type] 2 and nature, 3 that is, that
which [is divided in] 4 three. and you [were] 5 [informed]
about [these and that which is] 6 in three [dimensions] 7
by these [two (the fourth & fifth?)]. 8 you [were informed
that it] 9 is incorporeal 10 [...] 11
and after [...] 12 within [...] 13 every [...] which
[... and] 14 the things within them.

3. seal 5 the repentance

the [fifth,] 15 [concerning the] repentance [of] 16
those that are within me and 17 {concerning those} who sojourn
in that place (the fourth?). 18

4. seal 6 the self-generated ones

but the sixth, 19 concerning the self-generated ones, 20
concerning the incorporeal being 21 that exists individually
(cf. the perfect individuals), 22 together with those who abide
in 23 the truth of the all [in regard to] 24 understanding
and 25 assurance (or: stability).

5. seal 7 the autogenes

and the [seventh,] 26 concerning the self-begotten power 27
which [is the] 28 third [perfect mind, 29 [the
second (after barbelo) who extended to] 4 1 [the] fourth
(the sojourn) for salvation 2 [through] wisdom.

6. seal 8 the protophanes

and the eighth, 3 concerning the mind which is 4
[male, which] appeared 5 [in the beginning (i.e., "protophanes")],
as well as the substance 6 [which is incorporeal] and the 7
[intelligible] world.

7. seal 9 the kalyptos

the ninth, 8 [concerning the head] of the power 9
[that] appeared [in the] 10 [beginning.

8. seal 10 the aeon of barbelo

the] tenth, [concerning] 11 [barbelo, the] virgin 12
[who is male], that is, the aeon.13

9. seals 11-12 the triple powered one and the invisible
spirit

[the eleventh] and [the] 14 [twelfth] speak of the 15
invisible one who possesses 16 three powers 17 and
the insubstantial spirit 18 who belongs to 19 the
first unbegotten one (fem., i.e., first unbegotten power of the triple
powered one, which is the invisible spirit).

10. seal 13 the unknown silent one


the 20 thirteenth speaks concerning 21 [the] silent
one who was not 22 [known], even the foundation (katarchê
= ) of 23 the indiscriminables. 24


b. marsanes' insight into the nature of incorporeal
and corporeal reality
for it is i who have 25 [contemplated] that which truly exists.
26 [whether] individually or 27 [as a whole], by
difference 28 [i knew] that they [pre]-exist 29 [in
the] entire place (i. e., the aeonic realm) that is 5 1
eternal: all those that have come into 2 existence whether without
substance 3 or with substance, those who are 4 unbegotten,
and the divine aeons 5 together with the angels and the 6
souls without guile 7 and the soul-[garments], 8
the images of [the] 9 simple ones (souls?). and [afterwards
they] 10 were mixed with [those that were distinct from] 11
them (i.e., their bodies?). but [even the] 12 entire [perceptible]
substance 13 still resembles the [intelligible
substance] 14 as well as the insubstantial. [i have known] 15
the entire corruption [of the former (the perceptible realm)] 16
as well as the immortality of 17 the latter (fem., i.e., the
intelligible and insubstantial).
i have discriminated 18 and have attained
the boundary of the sense-perceptible 19 world (and) 20
the entire realm 21 of the incorporeal
essence. and 22 the intelligible world knew 23 by
discrimination 24 that in every respect the sense-perceptible
25 world is [worthy] 26 of being preserved entire,
[for] 27 i have not ceased speaking [of the] 28 autogenes,
[lest] 29 [anyone] be [ignorant] 6 1 in turn
of the entire place (i.e., the aeonic realm). 2


c. the saving descent of autogenes
he (autogenes) descended, again he descended 3 from the unbegotten
one 4 who is insubstantial, who 5 is the spirit.
the one (autogenes??) who exists 6 before all of them (the realms
below the barbelo aeon) extends 7 [to the divine] self-generated
ones. 8 the one who is 9 [substantial (autogenes)]
examines 10 [the all (the barbelo aeon)] and is 11
[the all and] resembles 12 [the all]. and from 13
[the single one] they [are] divided, 14 [so that] i experienced
15 many things, it being manifest 16 that he saved
a multitude. 17


d. the deployment of the barbelo aeon from the
triple powered one

1. marsanes inquires about the aeonic realm of
the triple powered one

but beyond all of these, 18 i am seeking the kingdom 19
of the triple powered one, 20 which has no beginning. whence
21 did he appear and 22 act to fill the 23 the
entire place (i. e., the aeonic realm) with his power? and 24
in what way did the unbegotten ones 25 come into existence without
being begotten? and 26 what are [the] differences among the
[aeons]? 27 [and] as for those who are unbegotten, 28
how many [are they]? and in what respect 29 [do they differ]
from each other?


2. the triple powered one actualizes the silence
of the unknown silent one

7 1 when i had inquired about these things 2
i perceived that he (the triple powered one) acted 3 from silence.
he exists 4 prior to those that 5 truly exist, that
belong to the realm of being. 6 he (the triple powered one)
is a pre-existent otherness 7 belonging to the one (the invisible
spirit) that 8 actualizes the silent one. 9 and the
silence of [that (the triple powered one) which follows] 10
him (the invisible spirit) acts. for [so] 11 [long as] the latter
(the spirit) [acts], 12 the former (the triple powered one)
[acts also]. 13 the [silence which belongs to the un-] 14
begotten one (the invisible spirit) is among [the aeons, and from] 15
the beginning he is in-[substantial]. 16 but the activity of
17 that one (the invisible spirit) <is> the triple powered
one. 18 the unbegotten one (the invisible spirit) is prior to
19 the aeon, since he is in-[substantial]. 20
and as for the summit of the 21 silence of the silent one,
22 it is possible <for> the summit (i.e., the invisible spirit)
23 of the energy of the triple 24 powered one to
behold it. and the one (the unknown silent one) who 25 exists,
who is silent, [who is] 26 beyond [insubstantiality], 27
manifested [the triple] 28 [powered, first-] 29 perfect
one.

3. the self-manifestation of the triple powered
one

[when he appeared] 8 1 to the powers, they rejoiced.
2 those that are within me were completed 3 together
with all the 4 rest. and they all blessed 5 the triple
powered one, 6 one by one, who 7 is [the] first-perfect
one, 8 [blessing] him in purity, [every]where 9 praising
the lord 10 [who exists] before the all, 11 [who
(is) the] triple powered one. 12 [it did not happen that] their
worshippings 13 [were audible], but [it was my part] 14
[to keep on] 15 [inquiring] how they had 16 become
silent. i would contemplate a 17 power that i hold 18 in
honor.

4. the barbelo aeon reveals itself as the triple
powered one's third power

when the third 19 power (i.e. the barbelo aeon) of the triple
powered one 20 contemplated him (the triple powered one), 21
it said to me (marsanes), "be silent 22 lest you should know
and flee 23 and come before me. but 24 know that
this one was 25 [silent], and concentrate on understanding.
26 for [the power still] keeps 27 [guiding] me into
28 [the aeon which] is barbelo, 29 [the] male [virgin]."


5. marsanes explains the barbelo aeon's deployment
from the invisible spirit

9 1 for this reason the 2 virgin became male
(as nous, the aeon of barbelo), 3 because she had separated
from the male (i.e., the invisible spirit). the 4 knowledge
stood outside of him, 5 as if belonging to him. 6
and she who exists is she who sought. 7 she is situated just
as 8 the triple powered one is situated. 9 she withdrew
10 from [these] two [powers] (the first two powers of the triple
powered one), 11 since she exists [outside of] 12 the
great one (the invisible spirit), [seeing what] 13 is above
[her, the perfect one (the triple powered one)] 14 who is silent,
[who has] 15 this [commandment] 16 to be silent.
his knowledge (gnôsis; cf. mind) 17 and his hypostasis
(hypostasis;  cf. existence) 18 and his activity
(energeia;  cf. life) 19 are those things that the
power (dynamis, i.e. barbelo) 20 of the triple powered
one expressed: 21


6. the barbelo aeon describes the praise of the
triple powered one

"we all have 22 withdrawn to ourselves. we have [become] 23
silent, [and] 24 when we [too] came to know [that he is] 25
the triple powered one, [we] 26 bowed down; we [gave glory and
we] 27 blessed him. [he conferred] 28 upon us [a
great revelation]." 29
[again] the invisible [spirit] 10 1
ran up 2 to his place. the entire place (i. e., the aeonic realm)
3 was revealed, the entire place unfolded 4 <until>
he reached the upper region. 5 again he went forth and caused
the 6 entire place to be illuminated, and the entire 7
place was illuminated.



e. marsanes receives the power of the barbelo aeon
and [i (marsanes)] have been given 8 the third part (i.e., knowledge,
the barbelo aeon) of 9 [the spirit] of the power of the triple
10 [powered] 11 [one]! blessed is 12 [the
aeon (of barbelo)]! it (the power) said:


f. through marsanes the barbelo aeon urges the
ascent towards the invisible spirit
"o 13 [inhabitants of these] places (the sensible world?)! it
is necessary 14 [for you (sg.) to contemplate] those that are
higher 15 than these (the denizens of the barbelo aeon?), and
tell them to the 16 powers. for you will become 17 [better]
than the elect 18 [in the last] times. 19 upward
mounts the invisible spirit! 20 and you (pl.) 21
[yourselves], ascend with him 22 [up above], since you have
23 [the] great [radiant] crown! 24 but on that day
25 you will see 26 [as you hasten to] ascend above
27 [with him]. and [even] the sense-perceptible 28

g. marsanes' ascent to the triple powered one
i [was dwelling] 16 among the aeons that were 17
generated. as i was permitted, [i] 18 came to be among those
that were un-[begotten]. 19 but i was dwelling in the [great]
20 aeon (of barbelo), although i [was separate from it]. 21
and [i saw] 22 [the] three powers [of] 23 the
triple [powered] one. 24 the [first (third?)] 25 [power
...] 26 and [...] 27 [...] 28 [...] 29
[...] 15 1 [... the] silent one and the 2

7 [...] 8 [...] 9 [...] 10

the nomenclature of the cosmic
powers and of the soul

a. the need to know the nomenclature of the cosmic
powers and of the soul
and [again after] 15 many [years, as for me], 16
when i saw the [father (?) i came to] 17 know him, and [...]
18 many [...] 19 partial [...] 20 for
ever [...] 21 the material ones [...] 22 worldly
[...] 23 above [...] 24 in addition [...] 25

... [it is necessary that] a deity [transfer them] 15 from [those
who] 16 [observe] the things that 17 [act in] them
into 18 [actuality]. name 19 [them according] to
their nomenclature, 20 [and let no] one [think] 21
[that you (pl.) are] inferior to [their] 22 [knowledge] and
their [hypostasis]. 23 and [in addition, so that] 24

b. the blessed authority's instructions on preparing
the soul
[and] the blessed authority (chief fem.) 17 said [to me]: 18
"among these [may] 19 she who [does not have it receive no glory].
20 for there is no glory [...] 21 nor even the one
(masc.) who [...] 22 for indeed the one [without glory] 23
[is] a ... [...]. 24 for [...] 25 [...] 26
[...] 27 [...] 28 [...] 29 [...]


c. the configurations and powers of the zodiacal
signs
21 1 [...] 2 [...] 3 [...] 4
[...] 5 [...] 6 [...] 7 [...] 8
[...] 9 [...] 10 [...] 11 [...]
12 [...] 13 [...] 14 [...] and the [zodiacal
signs] 15 [...] and the [...] 16 [...] and [...]
17 [...] which do not have [...] 18 [...] acquire
for [...] 19 [...] revolution 20 [...] and [it is
the] soul [that] 21 [has] the this [sort of] 22 [corporeality],
namely 23 [the] celestial soul [that] 24 [sur]rounds
[the world]. 25 [...] configuration [...] 26 [...]
which is [...] 27 [...] 28 [...] 29 [...]
22 1 [...] 2 [...] 3 [...] 4
[...] 5 [...] 6 [...] 7 [...] 8
[...] 9 [...] 10 [...] 11 [...]
12 [...] 13 [...] 14 [spiritual ...] ...
[...] 15 [... and] those that [have likeness] 16
[...] 17 [...]... those who [...] 18 [... the form
...] 19 [...] all the images [of which i] 20 [spoke].
[it is necessary that] 21 all the forms [become] 22
configurations, so that [the forms may] 23 become [the elements
(cf. letters)] 24 themselves [including the] 15 [smooth
(cf. inaspirates)] and the [rough (cf. aspirates), like] 26
[the voices] of animals [...] 27 [...] and the [...] 28
[...] 29 [...] (pages 23-24 missing) 25 1
[...] there.
but their (the signs of the zodiac) 2 powers,
which are the angels, 3 are in the form of 4 beasts
and animals. 5 some among them are 6 [polymorphous]
and contrary to 7 [nature]; they have [sounds] 8 for
(adapted to?) their names, that [is], 9 they are [distinct]
and [different] 10 in [appearance] 11 and [they are
bi-] 12 [formed]. but these that are 13 [homo-] phonic
by a third 14 originate from substance. 15
and concerning these, all of 16 these
(remarks) are sufficient, 17 since we have (already) spoken
about them. for [this] 18 distribution takes
place 19 again in these regions (i.e., here) in [the manner]
20 we have mentioned from the [beginning]. 21

d. the alphabet and the configurations of the soul

1. vowels and diphthongs: the first and second
configurations of the soul

however, the soul 22 too [has] 23 its configuration,
although it is diverse. 24 it is [in] 25 [its] form
26 that the configuration of the only begotten soul 27
resides. its configuration 28 is [the second] 26 1
spherical part--eêiou-- 2 while the first
goes around [it], 3 the self-begotten soul-- 4 aeêiouô.
5
[the] second configuration-- 6 eêiou--derives
from those [having] 7 two sounds (diphthongs). the first 8
that suffixes them is [the] 9 [upsilon], and [the iota
is its] 10 [companion. and these are the ones] 11
[you know] in [the radiance] 12 of the light.
[control] 13 yourselves, receive [the]
14 imperishable seed, 15 bear fruit, and 16
do not be 17 attached to your possessions. 18

2. tones/accents

but know that the oxytones (jise = oxys; or should it be "long vowels"
= makra = êô) 19 exist among the vowels 20
and the 21 diphthongs 22 beside them. but the [short
(vowels) (brachy eo; or should this be barytones = baru =
gajb?)] 23 are deficient, as well as the 24
[other sounds that] originate 25 through them. [and] those that
[are drawn (~perispwmenon i.e., circumflex)], 26 since
they are intermediate, 27 [are also deficient].

3. consonants and their combinations

the sounds of 28 [the semivowels (hemiphwna = z x
y l m n r s)] are 27 1 superior to the voiceless
(consonants b g d k p t th ph c = aphôna). 2 and
those that are double (z x ps = dipla) are superior 3
to the semivowels which 4 do not change (lmnr =ametabola).
and the aspirates (dasu = th ph xi) 5 are better
than the inaspirates (psila = k p t) <of> 6 the mute
consonants (b g d k p t th ph xi). 7 and as for those
that are intermediate (b g d = mesa), 8 their
combinations are many (e.g., by aspirate or "spiritual" precedence = ph
b p - xi g k - th d t). 9 they are ignorant [of] 10
the good ones (i.e., combinations) and 11 are combined with
the worse ones in the [middle]. 12
[as] in the case 13 of the nomenclature
for the [gods] 14 and the angels, it is [not that] 15
they (the consonants) are combined with each other 16 indiscriminately,
but 17 only that they have 8 a beneficial effect.
19 it just didn't happen 20 that their intention
(or: pronunciation) was apparent. 21
don't (sg.) [sin anymore], 22 and don't
dare to 23 have anything to do with sin.
now [i] 24 speak to you (sg.) [concerning
the] 25 [three configurations of the form] 26 of
the soul.

4. vowels and the second and third configurations
of the soul

[the] 27 third [configuration of the soul] 28 is
[a sphere and] 28 1 it is a spherical one that goes around
2 it. from the 3 simple vowels 4 <aaa,>
eee, <êêê,> iii, ooo,
uuu, ôôô 5 the diphthongs were
6 as follows: ai, au, 7 [e]i, eu,
êu, ou, ôu, oi, hi, 8 [u]i, ôi.
auei, euêu, oiou, 9 [gg]g, ggg, ggg,
aiau, 10 [eieu], êu, oiou, ôu,
ggg, 11 [ggg], aueieu, oiou, êu-- 12
three times for a male soul. 13 the third 14 configuration
is spherical; 15 the second configuration, 16 since
it goes around it, has 17 two sounds (is a diphthong).
the male soul's 18 third configuration
19 (consists) of the 20 simple vowels: 21
aaa, eee, êêê, iii, ooo, 22 uuu,
ôôô, ôôô, ôôô.
23 [and] this configuration is distinct 24 [from]
the first, but 25 [they resemble] each other 26 [and
they] make some 27 [easy sounds] of 28 [this sort:
aeê]oô (i.e., the protactic vowels of the diphthongs).
and 29 1 from these (are made) the diphthongs (by appending
i or u). 2

5. vowel combinations and the fourth and fifth configurations of the soul

so also the 3 fourth and the fifth: 4 with regard
to them, not everything was allowed to be 5 revealed, 6 but only those things that are
obvious. 7 you (pl.) were taught 8 about them, that
you should contemplate them 9 in order that they, too, might
10 seek and find [what] 11 they all are, either 12
through themselves alone 13 or through one another, 14
or (seek) to reveal [limits] 15 set from the beginning, 16
either with reference to themselves alone [or] 17 with reference
to one another.
just as [they (the letters)] 18 coexist
with each other [in] 19 speech, whether individually 20
or by similarity, [they are] 21 prepended (or) [they] 22
are appended. either their 23 [part] is derivative and 24
similar, whether through [the] 25 [long (makron)] (vowels
êô) or [through] 26 those of [dual time value
(dichronoi aiu), or] 27 through [the short (vowels
brachy eo)] 28 which are short [...] 29
[...] 30 1 or the oxytones (or: short vowels) or the 2 intermediate
tones (i.e., perispômena) or the barytones (or: short vowels). 3

6. consonant-vowel combinations: syllables

and (sometimes) <the> consonants 4 exist with the vowels, 5 and
by turns 6 they are prepended 7 and appended. 8
they constitute a nomenclature 9 [for] the angels. and (sometimes)
10 [the] consonants are 11 independent (self-existent?),
12 [and] diverse-- 13 they (txt. "it": sg. vb w.
neut. pl. subject?) prefix and they (txt. "it") suffix 14 the
hidden 15 gods (the graphically unrepresented phenomena of speech?).
by means of 16 beat and 17 pitch and 18
silence and attack 19 [they] summon the semivowels, 20
all of which 21 are subjected to a 22 single [sound].
just as it is only 13 the [unchanging (consonants l m n r
s)] <and> the double (consonants z ch ps) 24 that
exist among the semivowels (z ch ps l m n r s), 25 the
aspirates (dasy th ph xi) 26 [and the inaspirates
(psiloi k p t)] and the 27 [intermediates (b
g d)] constitute 28 [the voiceless (consonants [mute b
g d k p t th ph xi]).
contrary to] 29 [nature they (the consonants and vowels)]
are combined 30 [with one another, and] they are separate 31
1 from one another. they are 2 prepended and appended,
3 and they constitute an 4 ignorant nomenclature.
5 and they (the resulting syllables) become one or 6 two
or three or [four] 7 or five or six up to 8 seven
having a 9 [simple] sound. these that [have] 10 two
[sounds (diphthongs)] are grouped with [the] 11 [seventeen consonants.
among] 12 the previously named (~proônumos)
[some] are 13 deficient and 14 they are as if [they]
had no substance, 15 or as if [they] were an image [of] 16
substance, [or] as if they separate 17 the nature [that is]
good [from the one] 18 that [is evil] in the [middle.] 19
and you (sg.) [will assemble] 20 into those (patterns) that
resemble each other 21 the vowels [together with] 22
the consonants. some 23 are: bagad[a]zatha,
24 beged[e]zeqe, [bêgêdê]
25 zêthê, [bigidizithi, bogo]
26 dozotho, [buguduzuthu], 27 bôgôdô[zôthô,
and] 28 the rest. [and some are]: 29 ba[bebêbibobubô].
32 1 but the rest are 2 different: abebêbi
3 [b]ob, in order that you (sg.) might [assemble]
4 them and become separate from the 5 angels.

7. arithmology

and there 6 will be some effects. 7 a good point of departure
8 is from 9 [the] triad. it [extends] 10
[to that which (i.e., the dyad)] has need of [the one] 11 [that] confined
12 [it in] a shape (the triad).
<the> dyad 13 and the monad 14 do not resemble
anything; rather 15 they are principles. 16 the dyad
[constitutes] 17 a division [from the] monad, [and] 18
[it] belongs to the hypostasis (should this be substrate = hypokeimenon?).
19 but the tetrad received (the) [elements] 20 and
the pentad 21 received concord, and the 22 [hexad]
was perfected by 23 itself. the 24 [hebdomad] received
beauty, 25 [and the] ogdoad 26 [attuned its constituents]
27 [to harmony], 28 [and the ennead is] 29
[honored much more]. 33 1 and the [decad revealed]
2 the entire place (i. e., the aeonic realm). 3 but
the hendecad and the 4 [dodecad] have passed over 5 [into
the boundless], 6 [and] it [is higher than] the 7 hebdomad
[which is] 8 [bounded. ...] 9 [...] 10

8. syllables and nouns

14 [...] 15 [noun(s) ...] 16 [...] 17
promise that [the articulation marks (diairesis)] 18 begin [to
separate] 19 them by means of 20 a sign [and] 21
a point, the [uninflected (upright = :) one] 22 and the [inflected
(bent = klje)] one. 23 so also [are the images]
24 of being: 25 they derive [from a joining] 26
of the letters (elements) 27 in [a holy union] 34 1
according to a [juxtaposition] 2 where they exist independently.
3 [and] <they> exist with each 4 [other] by generation
or [by] 5 [their kinship]. and] according to
[their own] 6 [generation] they do not have 7 [...]

[the] sense-perceptible world 21 there exists the temple 22

24 [...] within 25 [an] eternity, they 26
[...] three 27 [...] to the four 28 [...] seal(s)
29 [...] clouds 35 1 [and the] waters, and
the [forms] 2 [of the] wax images, 3 [and] some emerald
images. 4
for the rest, i will 5 [teach you (sg.)]
about them. this is 6 [the] generation of the names. that (fem.)

9. words

but there exists gentle [discourse] 21 and there exists
another 22 discourse [related to] 23 [permanent (ahe
for rmhe?)] substance 24 of this [sort, by speaking]
25 of [that which is invisible], 26 and it [manifests]
27 the difference [between the same] 28 and the [different
and] 36 1 between the whole and a [part] 2 of
an [indivisible] substance. 3 and [that] power 4 has
[a] 5 share in [the joy]-- 6 in (both) discord and

16 [to know that the things that] exist 17 everywhere

with the corporeal 20 and the incorporeal ones. 21
this is the discourse on the hypostases 22 that one should 23
[know] in this way. if 24 [they do] not [speak] with one another,
25 [how then] does it (the discourse) help 26 [those
who] are troubled [with] 27 [it (the discourse) about that which is] visible?
28 [therefore] if one 37 1 knows it, one will
2 [speak] it. 3
but there are words, some 4 of which are [dual], 5
[and others] that exist 6 [separately, the ones that pertain]
7 to [substance (proper nouns?) ...]
8 [...] 9 [...]
10 [...] 11 [...] 12 [...] 13
[and] they [...] 14 ... [...] 15 or those which [...]
16 [... according to those that perdure] 17 or according
to [those that] have 18 time . and [these] 19 either
are separated 20 or they are joined with one another 21
or with themselves, either [the] 22 diphthongs, or the 23

count] once 16 [or twice], and thrice 17
[for the] vowels, 18 and twice 19 [for] the consonants,
20 [and] once for 21 the entire ensemble, and with 22 uncertainty for 23 [things
that] are subject to change 24 [as well as those things that] originated 25 [from them] and [everything] 26 thereafter. and 27 they are all [the names] 28
[at once. they] were 39 1 hidden, but they were pronounced
2 openly. they did not 3 stop being revealed, 4
nor did they stop 5 naming the angels. 6 the
vowels [are joined with] the 8 [consonants, whether] externally
9 [or] internally, 10 by means of [...] they 11
said [...] 12 [teach you ...] 13 again [in this way
they were counted] 14 four times, (and) they were [engendered]
15 three 16 times, and they became 17
[twelvefold]. 18



being worthy of and safeguarding
the revelation
for these reasons we have acquired 19 sufficiency; for it is
fitting that 20 each one acquire 21 power for himself
that he may bear fruit, 22 and that we 23 never heap

[m]arsanes


1. seals 1-3 the corporeal: the worldly and material
levels

the first 17 [and the] second and the 18 [third]
are for the worldly 19 and the material. i have 20
[informed] you concerning these, that you should 21 [guard]
your bodies. and 22 a sense-perceptible [power] 23
will [hide] those who will rest, 24 and they will be kept 25
[from the] passion(s) and division 26 [of the] (incarnational)
union.

2. seals 4-5 the incorporeal: the sojourn (seal
4) and repentance (seal 5)

the fourth (the sojourn) 27 [and the] fifth (the repentance)
which is above (it, i.e., the sojourn), 28 [are the ones] you
have come to know 29 [as divine]. 30 [the fourth,
concerning that which] 3 1 exists after (i.e., above)
the [somatic type] 2 and nature, 3 that is, that
which [is divided in] 4 three. and you [were] 5 [informed]
about [these and that which is] 6 in three [dimensions] 7
by these [two (the fourth & fifth?)]. 8 you [were informed
that it] 9 is incorporeal 10 [...] 11
and after [...] 12 within [...] 13 every [...] which
[... and] 14 the things within them.

3. seal 5 the repentance

the [fifth,] 15 [concerning the] repentance [of] 16
those that are within me and 17 {concerning those} who sojourn
in that place (the fourth?). 18

4. seal 6 the self-generated ones

but the sixth, 19 concerning the self-generated ones, 20
concerning the incorporeal being 21 that exists individually
(cf. the perfect individuals), 22 together with those who abide
in 23 the truth of the all [in regard to] 24 understanding
and 25 assurance (or: stability).

5. seal 7 the autogenes

and the [seventh,] 26 concerning the self-begotten power 27
which [is the] 28 third [perfect mind, 29 [the
second (after barbelo) who extended to] 4 1 [the] fourth
(the sojourn) for salvation 2 [through] wisdom.

6. seal 8 the protophanes

and the eighth, 3 concerning the mind which is 4
[male, which] appeared 5 [in the beginning (i.e., "protophanes")],
as well as the substance 6 [which is incorporeal] and the 7
[intelligible] world.

7. seal 9 the kalyptos

the ninth, 8 [concerning the head] of the power 9
[that] appeared [in the] 10 [beginning.

8. seal 10 the aeon of barbelo

the] tenth, [concerning] 11 [barbelo, the] virgin 12
[who is male], that is, the aeon.13

9. seals 11-12 the triple powered one and the invisible
spirit

[the eleventh] and [the] 14 [twelfth] speak of the 15
invisible one who possesses 16 three powers 17 and
the insubstantial spirit 18 who belongs to 19 the
first unbegotten one (fem., i.e., first unbegotten power of the triple
powered one, which is the invisible spirit).

10. seal 13 the unknown silent one


1. marsanes inquires about the aeonic realm of
the triple powered one

but beyond all of these, 18 i am seeking the kingdom 19
of the triple powered one, 20 which has no beginning. whence
21 did he appear and 22 act to fill the 23 the
entire place (i. e., the aeonic realm) with his power? and 24
in what way did the unbegotten ones 25 come into existence without
being begotten? and 26 what are [the] differences among the
[aeons]? 27 [and] as for those who are unbegotten, 28
how many [are they]? and in what respect 29 [do they differ]
from each other?


2. the triple powered one actualizes the silence
of the unknown silent one

7 1 when i had inquired about these things 2
i perceived that he (the triple powered one) acted 3 from silence.
he exists 4 prior to those that 5 truly exist, that
belong to the realm of being. 6 he (the triple powered one)
is a pre-existent otherness 7 belonging to the one (the invisible
spirit) that 8 actualizes the silent one. 9 and the
silence of [that (the triple powered one) which follows] 10
him (the invisible spirit) acts. for [so] 11 [long as] the latter
(the spirit) [acts], 12 the former (the triple powered one)
[acts also]. 13 the [silence which belongs to the un-] 14
begotten one (the invisible spirit) is among [the aeons, and from] 15
the beginning he is in-[substantial]. 16 but the activity of
17 that one (the invisible spirit) <is> the triple powered
one. 18 the unbegotten one (the invisible spirit) is prior to
19 the aeon, since he is in-[substantial]. 20
and as for the summit of the 21 silence of the silent one,
22 it is possible <for> the summit (i.e., the invisible spirit)
23 of the energy of the triple 24 powered one to
behold it. and the one (the unknown silent one) who 25 exists,
who is silent, [who is] 26 beyond [insubstantiality], 27
manifested [the triple] 28 [powered, first-] 29 perfect
one.

3. the self-manifestation of the triple powered
one

[when he appeared] 8 1 to the powers, they rejoiced.
2 those that are within me were completed 3 together
with all the 4 rest. and they all blessed 5 the triple
powered one, 6 one by one, who 7 is [the] first-perfect
one, 8 [blessing] him in purity, [every]where 9 praising
the lord 10 [who exists] before the all, 11 [who
(is) the] triple powered one. 12 [it did not happen that] their
worshippings 13 [were audible], but [it was my part] 14
[to keep on] 15 [inquiring] how they had 16 become
silent. i would contemplate a 17 power that i hold 18 in
honor.

4. the barbelo aeon reveals itself as the triple
powered one's third power

when the third 19 power (i.e. the barbelo aeon) of the triple
powered one 20 contemplated him (the triple powered one), 21
it said to me (marsanes), "be silent 22 lest you should know
and flee 23 and come before me. but 24 know that
this one was 25 [silent], and concentrate on understanding.
26 for [the power still] keeps 27 [guiding] me into
28 [the aeon which] is barbelo, 29 [the] male [virgin]."


5. marsanes explains the barbelo aeon's deployment
from the invisible spirit

9 1 for this reason the 2 virgin became male
(as nous, the aeon of barbelo), 3 because she had separated
from the male (i.e., the invisible spirit). the 4 knowledge
stood outside of him, 5 as if belonging to him. 6
and she who exists is she who sought. 7 she is situated just
as 8 the triple powered one is situated. 9 she withdrew
10 from [these] two [powers] (the first two powers of the triple
powered one), 11 since she exists [outside of] 12 the
great one (the invisible spirit), [seeing what] 13 is above
[her, the perfect one (the triple powered one)] 14 who is silent,
[who has] 15 this [commandment] 16 to be silent.
his knowledge (gnôsis; cf. mind) 17 and his hypostasis
(hypostasis;  cf. existence) 18 and his activity
(energeia;  cf. life) 19 are those things that the
power (dynamis, i.e. barbelo) 20 of the triple powered
one expressed: 21


6. the barbelo aeon describes the praise of the
triple powered one

"we all have 22 withdrawn to ourselves. we have [become] 23
silent, [and] 24 when we [too] came to know [that he is] 25
the triple powered one, [we] 26 bowed down; we [gave glory and
we] 27 blessed him. [he conferred] 28 upon us [a
great revelation]." 29
[again] the invisible [spirit] 10 1
ran up 2 to his place. the entire place (i. e., the aeonic realm)
3 was revealed, the entire place unfolded 4 <until>
he reached the upper region. 5 again he went forth and caused
the 6 entire place to be illuminated, and the entire 7
place was illuminated.


1. vowels and diphthongs: the first and second
configurations of the soul

however, the soul 22 too [has] 23 its configuration,
although it is diverse. 24 it is [in] 25 [its] form
26 that the configuration of the only begotten soul 27
resides. its configuration 28 is [the second] 26 1
spherical part--eêiou-- 2 while the first
goes around [it], 3 the self-begotten soul-- 4 aeêiouô.
5
[the] second configuration-- 6 eêiou--derives
from those [having] 7 two sounds (diphthongs). the first 8
that suffixes them is [the] 9 [upsilon], and [the iota
is its] 10 [companion. and these are the ones] 11
[you know] in [the radiance] 12 of the light.
[control] 13 yourselves, receive [the]
14 imperishable seed, 15 bear fruit, and 16
do not be 17 attached to your possessions. 18

2. tones/accents

but know that the oxytones (jise = oxys; or should it be "long vowels"
= makra = êô) 19 exist among the vowels 20
and the 21 diphthongs 22 beside them. but the [short
(vowels) (brachy eo; or should this be barytones = baru =
gajb?)] 23 are deficient, as well as the 24
[other sounds that] originate 25 through them. [and] those that
[are drawn (~perispwmenon i.e., circumflex)], 26 since
they are intermediate, 27 [are also deficient].

3. consonants and their combinations

the sounds of 28 [the semivowels (hemiphwna = z x
y l m n r s)] are 27 1 superior to the voiceless
(consonants b g d k p t th ph c = aphôna). 2 and
those that are double (z x ps = dipla) are superior 3
to the semivowels which 4 do not change (lmnr =ametabola).
and the aspirates (dasu = th ph xi) 5 are better
than the inaspirates (psila = k p t) <of> 6 the mute
consonants (b g d k p t th ph xi). 7 and as for those
that are intermediate (b g d = mesa), 8 their
combinations are many (e.g., by aspirate or "spiritual" precedence = ph
b p - xi g k - th d t). 9 they are ignorant [of] 10
the good ones (i.e., combinations) and 11 are combined with
the worse ones in the [middle]. 12
[as] in the case 13 of the nomenclature
for the [gods] 14 and the angels, it is [not that] 15
they (the consonants) are combined with each other 16 indiscriminately,
but 17 only that they have 8 a beneficial effect.
19 it just didn't happen 20 that their intention
(or: pronunciation) was apparent. 21
don't (sg.) [sin anymore], 22 and don't
dare to 23 have anything to do with sin.
now [i] 24 speak to you (sg.) [concerning
the] 25 [three configurations of the form] 26 of
the soul.

4. vowels and the second and third configurations
of the soul

[the] 27 third [configuration of the soul] 28 is
[a sphere and] 28 1 it is a spherical one that goes around
2 it. from the 3 simple vowels 4 <aaa,>
eee, <êêê,> iii, ooo,
uuu, ôôô 5 the diphthongs were
6 as follows: ai, au, 7 [e]i, eu,
êu, ou, ôu, oi, hi, 8 [u]i, ôi.
auei, euêu, oiou, 9 [gg]g, ggg, ggg,
aiau, 10 [eieu], êu, oiou, ôu,
ggg, 11 [ggg], aueieu, oiou, êu-- 12
three times for a male soul. 13 the third 14 configuration
is spherical; 15 the second configuration, 16 since
it goes around it, has 17 two sounds (is a diphthong).
the male soul's 18 third configuration
19 (consists) of the 20 simple vowels: 21
aaa, eee, êêê, iii, ooo, 22 uuu,
ôôô, ôôô, ôôô.
23 [and] this configuration is distinct 24 [from]
the first, but 25 [they resemble] each other 26 [and
they] make some 27 [easy sounds] of 28 [this sort:
aeê]oô (i.e., the protactic vowels of the diphthongs).
and 29 1 from these (are made) the diphthongs (by appending
i or u). 2

5. vowel combinations and the fourth and fifth configurations of the soul

so also the 3 fourth and the fifth: 4 with regard
to them, not everything was allowed to be 5 revealed, 6 but only those things that are
obvious. 7 you (pl.) were taught 8 about them, that
you should contemplate them 9 in order that they, too, might
10 seek and find [what] 11 they all are, either 12
through themselves alone 13 or through one another, 14
or (seek) to reveal [limits] 15 set from the beginning, 16
either with reference to themselves alone [or] 17 with reference
to one another.
just as [they (the letters)] 18 coexist
with each other [in] 19 speech, whether individually 20
or by similarity, [they are] 21 prepended (or) [they] 22
are appended. either their 23 [part] is derivative and 24
similar, whether through [the] 25 [long (makron)] (vowels
êô) or [through] 26 those of [dual time value
(dichronoi aiu), or] 27 through [the short (vowels
brachy eo)] 28 which are short [...] 29
[...] 30 1 or the oxytones (or: short vowels) or the 2 intermediate
tones (i.e., perispômena) or the barytones (or: short vowels). 3

6. consonant-vowel combinations: syllables

and (sometimes) <the> consonants 4 exist with the vowels, 5 and
by turns 6 they are prepended 7 and appended. 8
they constitute a nomenclature 9 [for] the angels. and (sometimes)
10 [the] consonants are 11 independent (self-existent?),
12 [and] diverse-- 13 they (txt. "it": sg. vb w.
neut. pl. subject?) prefix and they (txt. "it") suffix 14 the
hidden 15 gods (the graphically unrepresented phenomena of speech?).
by means of 16 beat and 17 pitch and 18
silence and attack 19 [they] summon the semivowels, 20
all of which 21 are subjected to a 22 single [sound].
just as it is only 13 the [unchanging (consonants l m n r
s)] <and> the double (consonants z ch ps) 24 that
exist among the semivowels (z ch ps l m n r s), 25 the
aspirates (dasy th ph xi) 26 [and the inaspirates
(psiloi k p t)] and the 27 [intermediates (b
g d)] constitute 28 [the voiceless (consonants [mute b
g d k p t th ph xi]).
contrary to] 29 [nature they (the consonants and vowels)]
are combined 30 [with one another, and] they are separate 31
1 from one another. they are 2 prepended and appended,
3 and they constitute an 4 ignorant nomenclature.
5 and they (the resulting syllables) become one or 6 two
or three or [four] 7 or five or six up to 8 seven
having a 9 [simple] sound. these that [have] 10 two
[sounds (diphthongs)] are grouped with [the] 11 [seventeen consonants.
among] 12 the previously named (~proônumos)
[some] are 13 deficient and 14 they are as if [they]
had no substance, 15 or as if [they] were an image [of] 16
substance, [or] as if they separate 17 the nature [that is]
good [from the one] 18 that [is evil] in the [middle.] 19
and you (sg.) [will assemble] 20 into those (patterns) that
resemble each other 21 the vowels [together with] 22
the consonants. some 23 are: bagad[a]zatha,
24 beged[e]zeqe, [bêgêdê]
25 zêthê, [bigidizithi, bogo]
26 dozotho, [buguduzuthu], 27 bôgôdô[zôthô,
and] 28 the rest. [and some are]: 29 ba[bebêbibobubô].
32 1 but the rest are 2 different: abebêbi
3 [b]ob, in order that you (sg.) might [assemble]
4 them and become separate from the 5 angels.

7. arithmology

and there 6 will be some effects. 7 a good point of departure
8 is from 9 [the] triad. it [extends] 10
[to that which (i.e., the dyad)] has need of [the one] 11 [that] confined
12 [it in] a shape (the triad).
<the> dyad 13 and the monad 14 do not resemble
anything; rather 15 they are principles. 16 the dyad
[constitutes] 17 a division [from the] monad, [and] 18
[it] belongs to the hypostasis (should this be substrate = hypokeimenon?).
19 but the tetrad received (the) [elements] 20 and
the pentad 21 received concord, and the 22 [hexad]
was perfected by 23 itself. the 24 [hebdomad] received
beauty, 25 [and the] ogdoad 26 [attuned its constituents]
27 [to harmony], 28 [and the ennead is] 29
[honored much more]. 33 1 and the [decad revealed]
2 the entire place (i. e., the aeonic realm). 3 but
the hendecad and the 4 [dodecad] have passed over 5 [into
the boundless], 6 [and] it [is higher than] the 7 hebdomad
[which is] 8 [bounded. ...] 9 [...] 10

8. syllables and nouns

[...] 11 [...] 12 from [...] 13 [...]
14 [...] 15 [noun(s) ...] 16 [...] 17
promise that [the articulation marks (diairesis)] 18 begin [to
separate] 19 them by means of 20 a sign [and] 21
a point, the [uninflected (upright = :) one] 22 and the [inflected
(bent = klje)] one. 23 so also [are the images]
24 of being: 25 they derive [from a joining] 26
of the letters (elements) 27 in [a holy union] 34 1
according to a [juxtaposition] 2 where they exist independently.
3 [and] <they> exist with each 4 [other] by generation
or [by] 5 [their kinship]. and] according to
[their own] 6 [generation] they do not have 7 [...]

[the] sense-perceptible world 21 there exists the temple 22
[which measures] seven hundred 23 [cubits], and a river which
24 [...] within 25 [an] eternity, they 26
[...] three 27 [...] to the four 28 [...] seal(s)
29 [...] clouds 35 1 [and the] waters, and
the [forms] 2 [of the] wax images, 3 [and] some emerald
images. 4
for the rest, i will 5 [teach you (sg.)]
about them. this is 6 [the] generation of the names. that (fem.)
which [was not] 7 generated [... from the] 8 beginning
[...] 9 [...] 10 [...] 11 [...] 12
[...] 13 [...] 14 [...] 15 with regard
to [...] 16 [...] 17 however, [... three] 18
times, when [closed], when 19 lengthened, when [short]. 20

9. words

but there exists gentle [discourse] 21 and there exists
another 22 discourse [related to] 23 [permanent (ahe
for rmhe?)] substance 24 of this [sort, by speaking]
25 of [that which is invisible], 26 and it [manifests]
27 the difference [between the same] 28 and the [different
and] 36 1 between the whole and a [part] 2 of
an [indivisible] substance. 3 and [that] power 4 has
[a] 5 share in [the joy]-- 6 in (both) discord and
[harmony--] 7 [of their honor], whether 8 [...] 9
[...] 10 [...] 11 [...] 12 [...]
13 [...] 14 [...] 15 [... it is] possible
16 [to know that the things that] exist 17 everywhere
[are honored] 18 always, 19 [since they] dwell (both)
with the corporeal 20 and the incorporeal ones. 21
this is the discourse on the hypostases 22 that one should 23
[know] in this way. if 24 [they do] not [speak] with one another,
25 [how then] does it (the discourse) help 26 [those
who] are troubled [with] 27 [it (the discourse) about that which is] visible?
28 [therefore] if one 37 1 knows it, one will
2 [speak] it. 3
but there are words, some 4 of which are [dual], 5
[and others] that exist 6 [separately, the ones that pertain]
7 to [substance (proper nouns?) ...]
8 [...] 9 [...]
10 [...] 11 [...] 12 [...] 13
[and] they [...] 14 ... [...] 15 or those which [...]
16 [... according to those that perdure] 17 or according
to [those that] have 18 time . and [these] 19 either
are separated 20 or they are joined with one another 21
or with themselves, either [the] 22 diphthongs, or the 23
simple [vowels], or every [...] 24 or [...] 25 or

[for the] vowels, 18 and twice 19 [for] the consonants,
20 [and] once for 21 the entire ensemble, and with 22 uncertainty for 23 [things
that] are subject to change 24 [as well as those things that] originated 25 [from them] and [everything] 26 thereafter. and 27 they are all [the names] 28
[at once. they] were 39 1 hidden, but they were pronounced
2 openly. they did not 3 stop being revealed, 4
nor did they stop 5 naming the angels. 6 the
vowels [are joined with] the 8 [consonants, whether] externally
9 [or] internally, 10 by means of [...] they 11
said [...] 12 [teach you ...] 13 again [in this way
they were counted] 14 four times, (and) they were [engendered]
15 three 16 times, and they became 17
[twelvefold]. 18
