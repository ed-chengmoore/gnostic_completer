 


PRAYER OF THE MESSENGER PAUL 

          Grant me your mercy. 
              My redeemer, redeem me,
              for I am yours.
            I came from you.
              You are my mind:
              give me birth.
            You are my treasure:
              open for me.
            You are my fullness:
              accept me.
            You are my rest:
              give me unlimited perfection.
          I pray to you,
              you who exist and preexisted,
              in the name exalted above every name, 
              through Jesus the anointed,
              lord of lords,
              king of the eternal realms.
              Give me your gifts, with no regret,
              through the human child,
              the spirit,
              the advocate of truth.
            Give me authority, I beg of you,
              give healing for my body, as I beg you,
              through the preacher of the gospel, 
              and redeem my enlightened soul forever, and my spirit,
              and disclose to my mind the firstborn of the fullness of grace.
          Grant what eyes of angels have not seen,
              what ears of rulers have not heard,
              and what has not arisen in the hearts of people, 
              who became angelic,
              and after the image of the animate god 
              when it was formed in the beginning.
              I have the faith of hope.
            And bestow upon me
              your beloved, chosen, blessed majesty,
              you who are the firstborn, the first-conceived,
              and the wonderful mystery of your house.
            For yours is the power and the glory and the praise and the greatness,
              forever and ever.
            Amen.
Prayer of Paul (the) Apostle [or, Messenger]. 
              In Peace. 
              Christ is holy.
