        [...] 5 [...] 6 [...] 7 [...] 8
        [...] 9 [...] 10 [material ...] 11 and
        a [power]. They 12 found him (the supreme Father?) with a pure
        heart 13 without their being afflicted by 14 evils.
        Those who have received 15 you (pl.) will be given a 16
        choice reward for 17 their endurance, and [they will] 18
        endure [the] 19 evils.
  [But] let none 20 of us be distressed [and] 21 think
        [in] his 22 heart that the supreme 23 Father [is aloof],
  24 for he looks upon the All [and] 25 takes care
        of them all. 26 And [he] has shown them 27 his [command]

Marsanes' Vision of the Nature,
        Structure, and Deployment of the Entirety
      

A. The Thirteen Seals
  But as for the thirteenth 13 seal, I have confirmed it 14
        together with [the] limit of 15 knowledge and the certainty
        16 of rest. 


1. Seals 1-3 The Corporeal: the Worldly and Material
          Levels

  The first 17 [and the] second and the 18 [third]
          are for the worldly 19 and the material. I have 20
          [informed] you concerning these, that you should 21 [guard]
          your bodies. And 22 a sense-perceptible [power] 23
          will [hide] those who will rest, 24 and they will be kept 25
          [from the] passion(s) and division 26 [of the] (incarnational)
          union. 

2. Seals 4-5 The Incorporeal: the Sojourn (Seal
          4) and Repentance (Seal 5)

  The fourth (the Sojourn) 27 [and the] fifth (the Repentance)
          which is above (it, i.e., the Sojourn), 28 [are the ones] you
          have come to know 29 [as divine]. 30 [The fourth,
          concerning that which] 3 1 exists after (i.e., above)
          the [somatic type] 2 and nature, 3 that is, that
          which [is divided in] 4 three. And you [were] 5 [informed]
          about [these and that which is] 6 in three [dimensions] 7
          by these [two (the fourth & fifth?)]. 8 You [were informed
          that it] 9 is incorporeal 10 [...] 11
          and after [...] 12 within [...] 13 every [...] which
          [... and] 14 the things within them. 

3. Seal 5 The Repentance

  The [fifth,] 15 [concerning the] repentance [of] 16
          those that are within me and 17 {concerning those} who sojourn
          in that place (the fourth?). 18 

4. Seal 6 The Self-generated Ones

  But the sixth, 19 concerning the self-generated ones, 20
          concerning the incorporeal being 21 that exists individually
          (cf. the perfect individuals), 22 together with those who abide
          in 23 the truth of the All [in regard to] 24 understanding
          and 25 assurance (or: stability). 

5. Seal 7 The Autogenes

  And the [seventh,] 26 concerning the self-begotten power 27
          which [is the] 28 Third [perfect Mind, 29 [the
          second (after Barbelo) who extended to] 4 1 [the] fourth
          (the Sojourn) for salvation 2 [through] Wisdom. 

6. Seal 8 The Protophanes

  And the eighth, 3 concerning the mind which is 4
          [male, which] appeared 5 [in the beginning (i.e., "Protophanes")],
          as well as the substance 6 [which is incorporeal] and the 7
          [intelligible] world. 

7. Seal 9 The Kalyptos

  The ninth, 8 [concerning the head] of the power 9
          [that] appeared [in the] 10 [beginning. 

8. Seal 10 The Aeon of Barbelo

  The] tenth, [concerning] 11 [Barbelo, the] virgin 12
          [who is male], that is, the Aeon.13 

9. Seals 11-12 The Triple Powered One and the Invisible
          Spirit

  [The eleventh] and [the] 14 [twelfth] speak of the 15
          Invisible One who possesses 16 three powers 17 and
          the insubstantial Spirit 18 who belongs to 19 the
          first unbegotten one (fem., i.e., first unbegotten power of the Triple
          Powered One, which is the Invisible Spirit). 

10. Seal 13 The Unknown Silent One


  The 20 thirteenth speaks concerning 21 [the] Silent
        One who was not 22 [known], even the foundation (katarchê
          = ) of 23 the indiscriminables. 24 


B. Marsanes' Insight into the Nature of Incorporeal
        and Corporeal Reality
  For it is I who have 25 [contemplated] that which truly exists.
        26 [Whether] individually or 27 [as a whole], by
        difference 28 [I knew] that they [pre]-exist 29 [in
        the] entire place (i. e., the aeonic realm) that is 5 1
        eternal: all those that have come into 2 existence whether without
        substance 3 or with substance, those who are 4 unbegotten,
        and the divine aeons 5 together with the angels and the 6
        souls without guile 7 and the soul-[garments], 8
        the images of [the] 9 simple ones (souls?). And [afterwards
        they] 10 were mixed with [those that were distinct from] 11
        them (i.e., their bodies?). But [even the] 12 entire [perceptible]
        substance 13 still resembles the [intelligible 
        substance] 14 as well as the insubstantial. [I have known] 15
        the entire corruption [of the former (the perceptible realm)] 16
        as well as the immortality of 17 the latter (fem., i.e., the
        intelligible and insubstantial).
            I have discriminated 18 and have attained
        the boundary of the sense-perceptible 19 world (and) 20
        the entire realm 21 of the incorporeal
        essence. And 22 the intelligible world knew 23 by
        discrimination 24 that in every respect the sense-perceptible
        25 world is [worthy] 26 of being preserved entire,
        [for] 27 I have not ceased speaking [of the] 28 Autogenes,
        [lest] 29 [anyone] be [ignorant] 6 1 in turn
        of the entire place (i.e., the aeonic realm). 2 


C. The Saving Descent of Autogenes
  He (Autogenes) descended, again he descended 3 from the Unbegotten
        One 4 who is insubstantial, who 5 is the Spirit.
        The one (Autogenes??) who exists 6 before all of them (the realms
        below the Barbelo Aeon) extends 7 [to the divine] self-generated
        ones. 8 The one who is 9 [substantial (Autogenes)]
        examines 10 [the all (the Barbelo Aeon)] and is 11
        [the all and] resembles 12 [the all]. And from 13
        [the single one] they [are] divided, 14 [so that] I experienced
        15 many things, it being manifest 16 that he saved
        a multitude. 17 


D. The Deployment of the Barbelo Aeon from the
        Triple Powered One

1. Marsanes inquires about the Aeonic Realm of
          the Triple Powered One

  But beyond all of these, 18 I am seeking the kingdom 19
          of the Triple Powered One, 20 which has no beginning. Whence
          21 did he appear and 22 act to fill the 23 the
          entire place (i. e., the aeonic realm) with his power? And 24
          in what way did the unbegotten ones 25 come into existence without
          being begotten? And 26 what are [the] differences among the
          [aeons]? 27 [And] as for those who are unbegotten, 28
          how many [are they]? And in what respect 29 [do they differ]
          from each other? 


2. The Triple Powered One actualizes the Silence
          of the Unknown Silent One

7 1 When I had inquired about these things 2
          I perceived that he (the Triple Powered One) acted 3 from silence.
          He exists 4 prior to those that 5 truly exist, that
          belong to the realm of Being. 6 He (the Triple Powered One)
          is a pre-existent otherness 7 belonging to the one (the Invisible
          Spirit) that 8 actualizes the Silent One. 9 And the
          silence of [that (the Triple Powered One) which follows] 10
          him (the Invisible Spirit) acts. For [so] 11 [long as] the latter
          (the Spirit) [acts], 12 the former (the Triple Powered One)
          [acts also]. 13 The [silence which belongs to the Un-] 14
          begotten One (the Invisible Spirit) is among [the aeons, and from] 15
          the beginning he is in-[substantial]. 16 But the activity of
          17 that One (the Invisible Spirit) <is> the Triple Powered
          One. 18 The Unbegotten One (the Invisible Spirit) is prior to
          19 the Aeon, since he is in-[substantial]. 20
And as for the summit of the 21 silence of the Silent One,
          22 it is possible <for> the summit (i.e., the Invisible Spirit)
          23 of the energy of the Triple 24 Powered One to
          behold it. And the One (the Unknown Silent One) who 25 exists,
          who is silent, [who is] 26 beyond [insubstantiality], 27
          manifested [the Triple] 28 [Powered, First-] 29 Perfect
          One. 

3. The Self-manifestation of the Triple Powered
            One

  [When he appeared] 8 1 to the powers, they rejoiced.
          2 Those that are within me were completed 3 together
          with all the 4 rest. And they all blessed 5 the Triple
          Powered One, 6 one by one, who 7 is [the] First-Perfect
          One, 8 [blessing] him in purity, [every]where 9 praising
          the Lord 10 [who exists] before the All, 11 [who
          (is) the] Triple Powered One. 12 [It did not happen that] their
          worshippings 13 [were audible], but [it was my part] 14
          [to keep on] 15 [inquiring] how they had 16 become
          silent. I would contemplate a 17 power that I hold 18 in
          honor. 

4. The Barbelo Aeon reveals Itself as the Triple
          Powered One's Third Power

  When the third 19 power (i.e. the Barbelo Aeon) of the Triple
          Powered One 20 contemplated him (the Triple Powered One), 21
          it said to me (Marsanes), "Be silent 22 lest you should know
          and flee 23 and come before me. But 24 know that
          this One was 25 [silent], and concentrate on understanding.
          26 For [the power still] keeps 27 [guiding] me into
          28 [the Aeon which] is Barbelo, 29 [the] male [Virgin]." 


5. Marsanes explains the Barbelo Aeon's Deployment
          from the Invisible Spirit

9 1 For this reason the 2 Virgin became male
          (as nous, the Aeon of Barbelo), 3 because she had separated
          from the male (i.e., the Invisible Spirit). The 4 Knowledge
          stood outside of him, 5 as if belonging to him. 6
          And she who exists is she who sought. 7 She is situated just
          as 8 the Triple Powered One is situated. 9 She withdrew
          10 from [these] two [powers] (the first two powers of the Triple
          Powered One), 11 since she exists [outside of] 12 the
          Great One (the Invisible Spirit), [seeing what] 13 is above
          [her, the Perfect One (the Triple Powered One)] 14 who is silent,
          [who has] 15 this [commandment] 16 to be silent.
          His knowledge (gnôsis; cf. Mind) 17 and his hypostasis
          (hypostasis;  cf. Existence) 18 and his activity
          (energeia;  cf. Life) 19 are those things that the
          power (dynamis, i.e. Barbelo) 20 of the Triple Powered
          One expressed: 21 


6. The Barbelo Aeon describes the Praise of the
          Triple Powered One

"We all have 22 withdrawn to ourselves. We have [become] 23
          silent, [and] 24 when we [too] came to know [that he is] 25
          the Triple Powered One, [we] 26 bowed down; we [gave glory and
          we] 27 blessed him. [He conferred] 28 upon us [a
          great revelation]." 29 
    [Again] the Invisible [Spirit] 10 1
          ran up 2 to his place. The entire place (i. e., the aeonic realm)
          3 was revealed, the entire place unfolded 4 <until>
          he reached the upper region. 5 Again he went forth and caused
          the 6 entire place to be illuminated, and the entire 7
            place was illuminated.
        


E. Marsanes receives the Power of the Barbelo Aeon
  And [I (Marsanes)] have been given 8 the third part (i.e., knowledge,
        the Barbelo Aeon) of 9 [the spirit] of the power of the Triple
        10 [Powered] 11 [One]! Blessed is 12 [the
        Aeon (of Barbelo)]! It (the power) said: 


F. Through Marsanes the Barbelo Aeon urges the
        Ascent towards the Invisible Spirit
"O 13 [inhabitants of these] places (the sensible world?)! It
        is necessary 14 [for you (sg.) to contemplate] those that are
        higher 15 than these (the denizens of the Barbelo Aeon?), and
        tell them to the 16 powers. For you will become 17 [better]
        than the elect 18 [in the last] times. 19 Upward
        mounts the Invisible Spirit! 20 And you (pl.) 21
        [yourselves], ascend with him 22 [up above], since you have
        23 [the] great [radiant] crown! 24 But on that day
        25 you will see 26 [as you hasten to] ascend above
        27 [with him]. And [even] the sense-perceptible 28
        [things that are] visible 29 [to you ...] and they ..." (pages

        15 the intellection. He (the Invisible Spirit??) exists eternally
        16 without substance 17 in the One who is, who is
        silent, 18 the One who is from the beginning, 19 who]
        is with-[out] substance 20 [...] part of [...] 21

G. Marsanes' Ascent to the Triple Powered One
  I [was dwelling] 16 among the aeons that were 17
        generated. As I was permitted, [I] 18 came to be among those
        that were un-[begotten]. 19 But I was dwelling in the [great]
        20 Aeon (of Barbelo), although I [was separate from it]. 21
          And [I saw] 22 [the] three powers [of] 23 the
        Triple [Powered] One. 24 The [first (third?)] 25 [power
        ...] 26 and [...] 27 [...] 28 [...] 29
        [...] 15 1 [... the] Silent One and the 2
        Triple Powered One, [and the One (i.e., the Spirit)] 3 that
        does not have breath. 4
    We took our stand [...] 5 [...] we [contemplated]

        16 1 [that] does not have breath, 2 [and he]
        exists in [unknowability]. 3 


H. Marsanes sees the Supreme Deity

        7 [...] 8 [...] 9 [...] 10

The Nomenclature of the Cosmic
          Powers and of the Soul

A. The Need to Know the Nomenclature of the Cosmic
        Powers and of the Soul

  [And] the blessed Authority (chief fem.) 17 said [to me]: 18
        "Among these [may] 19 she who [does not have it receive no glory].

which are the angels, 3 are in the form of 4 beasts
and animals. 5 Some among them are 6 [polymorphous]
and contrary to 7 [nature]; they have [sounds] 8 for
(adapted to?) their names, that [is], 9 they are [distinct]
and [different] 10 in [appearance] 11 and [they are
bi-] 12 [formed]. But these that are 13 [homo-] phonic
by a third 14 originate from substance. 15
    And concerning these, all of 16 these
(remarks) are sufficient, 17 since we have (already) spoken
about them. For [this] 18 distribution takes
place 19 again in these regions (i.e., here) in [the manner]
20 we have mentioned from the [beginning]. 21 

        D. The Alphabet and the Configurations of the Soul

1. Vowels and Diphthongs: The First and Second
          Configurations of the Soul

  However, the soul 22 too [has] 23 its configuration,
          although it is diverse. 24 It is [in] 25 [its] form
          26 that the configuration of the only begotten soul 27
          resides. Its configuration 28 is [the second] 26 1
            spherical part--eêiou-- 2 while the first
          goes around [it], 3 the self-begotten soul-- 4 aeêiouô.
          5
    [The] second configuration-- 6 eêiou--derives
          from those [having] 7 two sounds (diphthongs). The first 8
            that suffixes them is [the] 9 [upsilon], and [the iota
          is its] 10 [companion. And these are the ones] 11
          [you know] in [the radiance] 12 of the light.
              [Control] 13 yourselves, receive [the]
          14 imperishable seed, 15 bear fruit, and 16
          do not be 17 attached to your possessions. 18 

2. Tones/Accents

  But know that the oxytones (jise = oxys; or should it be "long vowels"
          = makra = êô) 19 exist among the vowels 20
          and the 21 diphthongs 22 beside them. But the [short
          (vowels) (brachy eo; or should this be barytones = baru =
          gajb?)] 23 are deficient, as well as the 24
          [other sounds that] originate 25 through them. [And] those that
          [are drawn (~perispwmenon i.e., circumflex)], 26 since
          they are intermediate, 27 [are also deficient]. 

3. Consonants and their Combinations

  The sounds of 28 [the semivowels (hemiphwna = z x
          y l m n r s)] are 27 1 superior to the voiceless
          (consonants b g d k p t th ph c = aphôna). 2 And
          those that are double (z x ps = dipla) are superior 3
            to the semivowels which 4 do not change (lmnr =ametabola).
          And the aspirates (dasu = th ph xi) 5 are better
          than the inaspirates (psila = k p t) <of> 6 the mute
          consonants (b g d k p t th ph xi). 7 And as for those
          that are intermediate (b g d = mesa), 8 their
          combinations are many (e.g., by aspirate or "spiritual" precedence = ph
            b p - xi g k - th d t). 9 They are ignorant [of] 10
          the good ones (i.e., combinations) and 11 are combined with
          the worse ones in the [middle]. 12
    [As] in the case 13 of the nomenclature
          for the [gods] 14 and the angels, it is [not that] 15
          they (the consonants) are combined with each other 16 indiscriminately,
          but 17 only that they have 8 a beneficial effect.
          19 It just didn't happen 20 that their intention
          (or: pronunciation) was apparent. 21
    Don't (sg.) [sin anymore], 22 and don't
          dare to 23 have anything to do with sin.
              Now [I] 24 speak to you (sg.) [concerning
          the] 25 [three configurations of the form] 26 of
          the soul.
        
4. Vowels and the Second and Third Configurations
          of the Soul

  [The] 27 third [configuration of the soul] 28 is
          [a sphere and] 28 1 it is a spherical one that goes around
          2 it. From the 3 simple vowels 4 <aaa,>
          eee, <êêê,> iii, ooo,
          uuu, ôôô 5 the diphthongs were
          6 as follows: ai, au, 7 [e]i, eu,
          êu, ou, ôu, oi, hi, 8 [u]i, ôi.
            auei, euêu, oiou, 9 [gg]g, ggg, ggg,
          aiau, 10 [eieu], êu, oiou, ôu,
            ggg, 11 [ggg], aueieu, oiou, êu-- 12
          three times for a male soul. 13 The third 14 configuration
          is spherical; 15 the second configuration, 16 since
          it goes around it, has 17 two sounds (is a diphthong).
              The male soul's 18 third configuration
          19 (consists) of the 20 simple vowels: 21
aaa, eee, êêê, iii, ooo, 22 uuu,
            ôôô, ôôô, ôôô.
          23 [And] this configuration is distinct 24 [from]
          the first, but 25 [they resemble] each other 26 [and
          they] make some 27 [easy sounds] of 28 [this sort:
          aeê]oô (i.e., the protactic vowels of the diphthongs).
          And 29 1 from these (are made) the diphthongs (by appending
          I or u). 2 

5. Vowel Combinations and the Fourth and Fifth Configurations of the Soul

  So also the 3 fourth and the fifth: 4 with regard
          to them, not everything was allowed to be 5 revealed, 6 but only those things that are
          obvious. 7 You (pl.) were taught 8 about them, that
          you should contemplate them 9 in order that they, too, might
          10 seek and find [what] 11 they all are, either 12
          through themselves alone 13 or through one another, 14
          or (seek) to reveal [limits] 15 set from the beginning, 16
          either with reference to themselves alone [or] 17 with reference
          to one another.
              Just as [they (the letters)] 18 coexist
          with each other [in] 19 speech, whether individually 20
          or by similarity, [they are] 21 prepended (or) [they] 22
          are appended. Either their 23 [part] is derivative and 24
          similar, whether through [the] 25 [long (makron)] (vowels
          êô) or [through] 26 those of [dual time value
          (dichronoi aiu), or] 27 through [the short (vowels
          brachy eo)] 28 which are short [...] 29
          [...] 30 1 or the oxytones (or: short vowels) or the 2 intermediate
          tones (i.e., perispômena) or the barytones (or: short vowels). 3

6. Consonant-Vowel Combinations: Syllables

  And (sometimes) <the> consonants 4 exist with the vowels, 5 and
          by turns 6 they are prepended 7 and appended. 8
            They constitute a nomenclature 9 [for] the angels. And (sometimes)
          10 [the] consonants are 11 independent (self-existent?),
          12 [and] diverse-- 13 they (txt. "it": sg. vb w.
          neut. pl. subject?) prefix and they (txt. "it") suffix 14 the
          hidden 15 gods (the graphically unrepresented phenomena of speech?).
          By means of 16 beat and 17 pitch and 18
          silence and attack 19 [they] summon the semivowels, 20
          all of which 21 are subjected to a 22 single [sound].
          Just as it is only 13 the [unchanging (consonants l m n r
            s)] <and> the double (consonants z ch ps) 24 that
          exist among the semivowels (z ch ps l m n r s), 25 the
          aspirates (dasy th ph xi) 26 [and the inaspirates
          (psiloi k p t)] and the 27 [intermediates (b
            g d)] constitute 28 [the voiceless (consonants [mute b
              g d k p t th ph xi]).
          Contrary to] 29 [nature they (the consonants and vowels)]
          are combined 30 [with one another, and] they are separate 31
1 from one another. They are 2 prepended and appended,
          3 and they constitute an 4 ignorant nomenclature.
          5 And they (the resulting syllables) become one or 6 two
          or three or [four] 7 or five or six up to 8 seven
          having a 9 [simple] sound. These that [have] 10 two
          [sounds (diphthongs)] are grouped with [the] 11 [seventeen consonants.
              Among] 12 the previously named (~proônumos)
          [some] are 13 deficient and 14 they are as if [they]
          had no substance, 15 or as if [they] were an image [of] 16
          substance, [or] as if they separate 17 the nature [that is]
          good [from the one] 18 that [is evil] in the [middle.] 19
          And you (sg.) [will assemble] 20 into those (patterns) that
          resemble each other 21 the vowels [together with] 22
          the consonants. Some 23 are: bagad[a]zatha,
          24 beged[e]zeqe, [bêgêdê]
          25 zêthê, [bigidizithi, bogo]
          26 dozotho, [buguduzuthu], 27 bôgôdô[zôthô,
          and] 28 the rest. [And some are]: 29 ba[bebêbibobubô].
          32 1 But the rest are 2 different: abebêbi
3 [b]ob, in order that you (sg.) might [assemble]
          4 them and become separate from the 5 angels. 

7. Arithmology

  And there 6 will be some effects. 7 A good point of departure 
          8 is from 9 [the] Triad. It [extends] 10
          [to that which (i.e., the Dyad)] has need of [the One] 11 [that] confined 
          12 [it in] a shape (the Triad).
          <The> Dyad 13 and the Monad 14 do not resemble
          anything; rather 15 they are principles. 16 The Dyad
          [constitutes] 17 a division [from the] Monad, [and] 18
          [it] belongs to the hypostasis (should this be substrate = hypokeimenon?).
          19 But the Tetrad received (the) [elements] 20 and
          the Pentad 21 received concord, and the 22 [Hexad]
          was perfected by 23 itself. The 24 [Hebdomad] received
          beauty, 25 [and the] Ogdoad 26 [attuned its constituents]
          27 [to harmony], 28 [and the Ennead is] 29
          [honored much more]. 33 1 And the [Decad revealed]
          2 the entire place (i. e., the aeonic realm). 3 But
          the Hendecad and the 4 [Dodecad] have passed over 5 [into
          the boundless], 6 [and] it [is higher than] the 7 Hebdomad
          [which is] 8 [bounded. ...] 9 [...] 10 

8. Syllables and Nouns

  [...] 11 [...] 12 from [...] 13 [...]
          14 [...] 15 [noun(s) ...] 16 [...] 17
          promise that [the articulation marks (diairesis)] 18 begin [to
          separate] 19 them by means of 20 a sign [and] 21
          a point, the [uninflected (upright = :) one] 22 and the [inflected
          (bent = klje)] one. 23 So also [are the images]
          24 of being: 25 they derive [from a joining] 26
          of the letters (elements) 27 in [a holy union] 34 1
            according to a [juxtaposition] 2 where they exist independently.
          3 [And] <they> exist with each 4 [other] by generation
          or [by] 5 [their kinship]. And] according to
          [their own] 6 [generation] they do not have 7 [...]
          these [...] 8 [...] 9 [...] 10 [...] 11

          [which measures] seven hundred 23 [cubits], and a river which
          24 [...] within 25 [an] eternity, they 26

          the [forms] 2 [of the] wax images, 3 [and] some emerald
          images. 4
    For the rest, I will 5 [teach you (sg.)]
          about them. This is 6 [the] generation of the names. That (fem.)
          which [was not] 7 generated [... from the] 8 beginning

          times, when [closed], when 19 lengthened, when [short]. 20 

9. Words

  But there exists gentle [discourse] 21 and there exists
          another 22 discourse [related to] 23 [permanent (ahe
          for rmhe?)] substance 24 of this [sort, by speaking]
          25 of [that which is invisible], 26 and it [manifests]
          27 the difference [between the Same] 28 and the [Different
          and] 36 1 between the whole and a [part] 2 of
          an [indivisible] substance. 3 And [that] power 4 has
          [a] 5 share in [the joy]-- 6 in (both) discord and
          [harmony--] 7 [of their honor], whether 8 [...] 9
            [...] 10 [...] 11 [...] 12 [...]
          13 [...] 14 [...] 15 [... it is] possible
          16 [to know that the things that] exist 17 everywhere
          [are honored] 18 always, 19 [since they] dwell (both)
          with the corporeal 20 and the incorporeal ones. 21
          This is the discourse on the hypostases 22 that one should 23
          [know] in this way. If 24 [they do] not [speak] with one another,
          25 [how then] does it (the discourse) help 26 [those
          who] are troubled [with] 27 [it (the discourse) about that which is] visible?
          28 [Therefore] if one 37 1 knows it, one will
          2 [speak] it. 3
But there are words, some 4 of which are [dual], 5
            [and others] that exist 6 [separately, the ones that pertain]
          7 to [substance (proper nouns?) ...]
          8 [...] 9 [...]
          10 [...] 11 [...] 12 [...] 13
          [and] they [...] 14 ... [...] 15 or those which [...]
          16 [... according to those that perdure] 17 or according
          to [those that] have 18 time . And [these] 19 either
          are separated 20 or they are joined with one another 21
          or with themselves, either [the] 22 diphthongs, or the 23
          simple [vowels], or every [...] 24 or [...] 25 or
          [...] 26 [exist] just as [...] 27 [exist] ... [...]
          28 the [consonants ...] 38 1 they exist individually
          2 until they are divided 3 and joined.
              Now some 4 are able 5 [to
          generate the consonants] 6 [letter] by [letter] ...] 7
            [... difference] 8 [...] 9 [...] 10

          count] once 16 [or twice], and thrice 17
          [for the] vowels, 18 and twice 19 [for] the consonants,
          20 [and] once for 21 the entire ensemble, and with 22 uncertainty for 23 [things
          that] are subject to change 24 [as well as those things that] originated 25 [from them] and [everything] 26 thereafter. And 27 they are all [the names] 28
          [at once. They] were 39 1 hidden, but they were pronounced
          2 openly. They did not 3 stop being revealed, 4
            nor did they stop 5 naming the angels. 6 The
          vowels [are joined with] the 8 [consonants, whether] externally
          9 [or] internally, 10 by means of [...] they 11
          said [...] 12 [teach you ...] 13 again [in this way
          they were counted] 14 four times, (and) they were [engendered]
          15 three 16 times, and they became 17
          [twelvefold]. 18 



Being Worthy of and Safeguarding
          the Revelation
  For these reasons we have acquired 19 sufficiency; for it is
        fitting that 20 each one acquire 21 power for himself
        that he may bear fruit, 22 and that we 23 never heap
        24 scorn [on] the mysteries 25 [...] the [...] 26
        For [...] which [is ...] 27 [... the] souls [...] 28
        [... the] signs of the Zodiac [...] 29 [...] 30 [...]
        40 1 a new hypostasis. 2 And the reward which
        will 3 be provided for such a one 4 is salvation.
        5 But the opposite will 6 happen there to the one
        7 who commits sin. [The one who commits] sin 8 by
        himself [...] will be 9 [in a ... in a] 10 [...]
        11 [... these]. 12
    [Ponder them] so that, 13 before you (sg.) examine
        14 what one 15 might [convey] to another, 16
        [you may receive an] exalted power 17 and a divine knowledge 18
        and an ability that 19 cannot be resisted. 20 But
        you (sg.) shall examine 21 who is worthy that he should 22
        reveal them, knowing 23 that they [will ... down] 24
        to the [...] who 25 sin. Therefore [...] 26 [the
        Father ...] 27 [...] 28 [...] 29 [...]
        41 1 that which is fitting. Do not desire 2 to
        empower the sense-perceptible world 3 by not attending to me,
        4 the one who has received the salvation 5 (that
        comes) from the intelligible world. 6
    But as for these <discourses>, beware your 7
          [divulging] them to [any] one. 8 [...] ... 9 [...]
        10 [...] 11 [...] lest [he succeed] 12
        [in understanding them] and take [them away]. 13 [And, as for
        the remainder], 14 I [will speak to] them of the [completion]
        15 [of my discourse] lest 16 the sinful person 17
        [divulge them to others]. 18 They did not understand them, namely
        the embodied 19 souls upon 20 the earth, as well
        as those outside of 21 the body, who are in heaven, 22
        more numerous than the angels.

1 1 [...] 2 [...] 3 [...] 4
        [...] 5 [...] 6 [...] 7 [...] 8
        [...] 9 [...] 10 [material ...] 11 and
        a [power]. They 12 found him (the supreme Father?) with a pure
        heart 13 without their being afflicted by 14 evils.
        Those who have received 15 you (pl.) will be given a 16
        choice reward for 17 their endurance, and [they will] 18
        endure [the] 19 evils.
  [But] let none 20 of us be distressed [and] 21 think
        [in] his 22 heart that the supreme 23 Father [is aloof],
  24 for he looks upon the All [and] 25 takes care
        of them all. 26 And [he] has shown them 27 his [command]
  28  since it is they who speak [...] 2 1 [...] 2

Marsanes' Vision of the Nature,
        Structure, and Deployment of the Entirety
      

A. The Thirteen Seals
  But as for the thirteenth 13 seal, I have confirmed it 14
        together with [the] limit of 15 knowledge and the certainty
        16 of rest. 


1. Seals 1-3 The Corporeal: the Worldly and Material
          Levels

  The first 17 [and the] second and the 18 [third]
          are for the worldly 19 and the material. I have 20
          [informed] you concerning these, that you should 21 [guard]
          your bodies. And 22 a sense-perceptible [power] 23
          will [hide] those who will rest, 24 and they will be kept 25
          [from the] passion(s) and division 26 [of the] (incarnational)
          union. 

2. Seals 4-5 The Incorporeal: the Sojourn (Seal
          4) and Repentance (Seal 5)

  The fourth (the Sojourn) 27 [and the] fifth (the Repentance)
          which is above (it, i.e., the Sojourn), 28 [are the ones] you
          have come to know 29 [as divine]. 30 [The fourth,
          concerning that which] 3 1 exists after (i.e., above)
          the [somatic type] 2 and nature, 3 that is, that
          which [is divided in] 4 three. And you [were] 5 [informed]
          about [these and that which is] 6 in three [dimensions] 7
          by these [two (the fourth & fifth?)]. 8 You [were informed
          that it] 9 is incorporeal 10 [...] 11
          and after [...] 12 within [...] 13 every [...] which
          [... and] 14 the things within them. 

3. Seal 5 The Repentance

  The [fifth,] 15 [concerning the] repentance [of] 16
          those that are within me and 17 {concerning those} who sojourn
          in that place (the fourth?). 18 

4. Seal 6 The Self-generated Ones

  But the sixth, 19 concerning the self-generated ones, 20
          concerning the incorporeal being 21 that exists individually
          (cf. the perfect individuals), 22 together with those who abide
          in 23 the truth of the All [in regard to] 24 understanding
          and 25 assurance (or: stability). 

5. Seal 7 The Autogenes

  And the [seventh,] 26 concerning the self-begotten power 27
          which [is the] 28 Third [perfect Mind, 29 [the
          second (after Barbelo) who extended to] 4 1 [the] fourth
          (the Sojourn) for salvation 2 [through] Wisdom. 

6. Seal 8 The Protophanes

  And the eighth, 3 concerning the mind which is 4
          [male, which] appeared 5 [in the beginning (i.e., "Protophanes")],
          as well as the substance 6 [which is incorporeal] and the 7
          [intelligible] world. 

7. Seal 9 The Kalyptos

  The ninth, 8 [concerning the head] of the power 9
          [that] appeared [in the] 10 [beginning. 

8. Seal 10 The Aeon of Barbelo

  The] tenth, [concerning] 11 [Barbelo, the] virgin 12
          [who is male], that is, the Aeon.13 

9. Seals 11-12 The Triple Powered One and the Invisible
          Spirit

  [The eleventh] and [the] 14 [twelfth] speak of the 15
          Invisible One who possesses 16 three powers 17 and
          the insubstantial Spirit 18 who belongs to 19 the
          first unbegotten one (fem., i.e., first unbegotten power of the Triple
          Powered One, which is the Invisible Spirit). 

10. Seal 13 The Unknown Silent One


  The 20 thirteenth speaks concerning 21 [the] Silent
        One who was not 22 [known], even the foundation (katarchê
          = ) of 23 the indiscriminables. 24 


B. Marsanes' Insight into the Nature of Incorporeal
        and Corporeal Reality
  For it is I who have 25 [contemplated] that which truly exists.
        26 [Whether] individually or 27 [as a whole], by
        difference 28 [I knew] that they [pre]-exist 29 [in
        the] entire place (i. e., the aeonic realm) that is 5 1
        eternal: all those that have come into 2 existence whether without
        substance 3 or with substance, those who are 4 unbegotten,
        and the divine aeons 5 together with the angels and the 6
        souls without guile 7 and the soul-[garments], 8
        the images of [the] 9 simple ones (souls?). And [afterwards
        they] 10 were mixed with [those that were distinct from] 11
        them (i.e., their bodies?). But [even the] 12 entire [perceptible]
        substance 13 still resembles the [intelligible 
        substance] 14 as well as the insubstantial. [I have known] 15
        the entire corruption [of the former (the perceptible realm)] 16
        as well as the immortality of 17 the latter (fem., i.e., the
        intelligible and insubstantial).
            I have discriminated 18 and have attained
        the boundary of the sense-perceptible 19 world (and) 20
        the entire realm 21 of the incorporeal
        essence. And 22 the intelligible world knew 23 by
        discrimination 24 that in every respect the sense-perceptible
        25 world is [worthy] 26 of being preserved entire,
        [for] 27 I have not ceased speaking [of the] 28 Autogenes,
        [lest] 29 [anyone] be [ignorant] 6 1 in turn
        of the entire place (i.e., the aeonic realm). 2 


C. The Saving Descent of Autogenes
  He (Autogenes) descended, again he descended 3 from the Unbegotten
        One 4 who is insubstantial, who 5 is the Spirit.
        The one (Autogenes??) who exists 6 before all of them (the realms
        below the Barbelo Aeon) extends 7 [to the divine] self-generated
        ones. 8 The one who is 9 [substantial (Autogenes)]
        examines 10 [the all (the Barbelo Aeon)] and is 11
        [the all and] resembles 12 [the all]. And from 13
        [the single one] they [are] divided, 14 [so that] I experienced
        15 many things, it being manifest 16 that he saved
        a multitude. 17 


D. The Deployment of the Barbelo Aeon from the
        Triple Powered One

1. Marsanes inquires about the Aeonic Realm of
          the Triple Powered One

  But beyond all of these, 18 I am seeking the kingdom 19
          of the Triple Powered One, 20 which has no beginning. Whence
          21 did he appear and 22 act to fill the 23 the
          entire place (i. e., the aeonic realm) with his power? And 24
          in what way did the unbegotten ones 25 come into existence without
          being begotten? And 26 what are [the] differences among the
          [aeons]? 27 [And] as for those who are unbegotten, 28
          how many [are they]? And in what respect 29 [do they differ]
          from each other? 


2. The Triple Powered One actualizes the Silence
          of the Unknown Silent One

7 1 When I had inquired about these things 2
          I perceived that he (the Triple Powered One) acted 3 from silence.
          He exists 4 prior to those that 5 truly exist, that
          belong to the realm of Being. 6 He (the Triple Powered One)
          is a pre-existent otherness 7 belonging to the one (the Invisible
          Spirit) that 8 actualizes the Silent One. 9 And the
          silence of [that (the Triple Powered One) which follows] 10
          him (the Invisible Spirit) acts. For [so] 11 [long as] the latter
          (the Spirit) [acts], 12 the former (the Triple Powered One)
          [acts also]. 13 The [silence which belongs to the Un-] 14
          begotten One (the Invisible Spirit) is among [the aeons, and from] 15
          the beginning he is in-[substantial]. 16 But the activity of
          17 that One (the Invisible Spirit) <is> the Triple Powered
          One. 18 The Unbegotten One (the Invisible Spirit) is prior to
          19 the Aeon, since he is in-[substantial]. 20
And as for the summit of the 21 silence of the Silent One,
          22 it is possible <for> the summit (i.e., the Invisible Spirit)
          23 of the energy of the Triple 24 Powered One to
          behold it. And the One (the Unknown Silent One) who 25 exists,
          who is silent, [who is] 26 beyond [insubstantiality], 27
          manifested [the Triple] 28 [Powered, First-] 29 Perfect
          One. 

3. The Self-manifestation of the Triple Powered
            One

  [When he appeared] 8 1 to the powers, they rejoiced.
          2 Those that are within me were completed 3 together
          with all the 4 rest. And they all blessed 5 the Triple
          Powered One, 6 one by one, who 7 is [the] First-Perfect
          One, 8 [blessing] him in purity, [every]where 9 praising
          the Lord 10 [who exists] before the All, 11 [who
          (is) the] Triple Powered One. 12 [It did not happen that] their
          worshippings 13 [were audible], but [it was my part] 14
          [to keep on] 15 [inquiring] how they had 16 become
          silent. I would contemplate a 17 power that I hold 18 in
          honor. 

4. The Barbelo Aeon reveals Itself as the Triple
          Powered One's Third Power

  When the third 19 power (i.e. the Barbelo Aeon) of the Triple
          Powered One 20 contemplated him (the Triple Powered One), 21
          it said to me (Marsanes), "Be silent 22 lest you should know
          and flee 23 and come before me. But 24 know that
          this One was 25 [silent], and concentrate on understanding.
          26 For [the power still] keeps 27 [guiding] me into
          28 [the Aeon which] is Barbelo, 29 [the] male [Virgin]." 


5. Marsanes explains the Barbelo Aeon's Deployment
          from the Invisible Spirit

9 1 For this reason the 2 Virgin became male
          (as nous, the Aeon of Barbelo), 3 because she had separated
          from the male (i.e., the Invisible Spirit). The 4 Knowledge
          stood outside of him, 5 as if belonging to him. 6
          And she who exists is she who sought. 7 She is situated just
          as 8 the Triple Powered One is situated. 9 She withdrew
          10 from [these] two [powers] (the first two powers of the Triple
          Powered One), 11 since she exists [outside of] 12 the
          Great One (the Invisible Spirit), [seeing what] 13 is above
          [her, the Perfect One (the Triple Powered One)] 14 who is silent,
          [who has] 15 this [commandment] 16 to be silent.
          His knowledge (gnôsis; cf. Mind) 17 and his hypostasis
          (hypostasis;  cf. Existence) 18 and his activity
          (energeia;  cf. Life) 19 are those things that the
          power (dynamis, i.e. Barbelo) 20 of the Triple Powered
          One expressed: 21 


6. The Barbelo Aeon describes the Praise of the
          Triple Powered One

"We all have 22 withdrawn to ourselves. We have [become] 23
          silent, [and] 24 when we [too] came to know [that he is] 25
          the Triple Powered One, [we] 26 bowed down; we [gave glory and
          we] 27 blessed him. [He conferred] 28 upon us [a
          great revelation]." 29 
    [Again] the Invisible [Spirit] 10 1
          ran up 2 to his place. The entire place (i. e., the aeonic realm)
          3 was revealed, the entire place unfolded 4 <until>
          he reached the upper region. 5 Again he went forth and caused
          the 6 entire place to be illuminated, and the entire 7
            place was illuminated.
        


E. Marsanes receives the Power of the Barbelo Aeon
  And [I (Marsanes)] have been given 8 the third part (i.e., knowledge,
        the Barbelo Aeon) of 9 [the spirit] of the power of the Triple
        10 [Powered] 11 [One]! Blessed is 12 [the
        Aeon (of Barbelo)]! It (the power) said: 


F. Through Marsanes the Barbelo Aeon urges the
        Ascent towards the Invisible Spirit
"O 13 [inhabitants of these] places (the sensible world?)! It
        is necessary 14 [for you (sg.) to contemplate] those that are
        higher 15 than these (the denizens of the Barbelo Aeon?), and
        tell them to the 16 powers. For you will become 17 [better]
        than the elect 18 [in the last] times. 19 Upward
        mounts the Invisible Spirit! 20 And you (pl.) 21
        [yourselves], ascend with him 22 [up above], since you have
        23 [the] great [radiant] crown! 24 But on that day
        25 you will see 26 [as you hasten to] ascend above
        27 [with him]. And [even] the sense-perceptible 28

G. Marsanes' Ascent to the Triple Powered One
  I [was dwelling] 16 among the aeons that were 17
        generated. As I was permitted, [I] 18 came to be among those
        that were un-[begotten]. 19 But I was dwelling in the [great]
        20 Aeon (of Barbelo), although I [was separate from it]. 21
          And [I saw] 22 [the] three powers [of] 23 the
        Triple [Powered] One. 24 The [first (third?)] 25 [power

          Powers and of the Soul

        Powers and of the Soul

        their nomenclature, 20 [and let no] one [think] 21
        [that you (pl.) are] inferior to [their] 22 [knowledge] and

B. The Blessed Authority's Instructions on Preparing
        the Soul
  [And] the blessed Authority (chief fem.) 17 said [to me]: 18
        "Among these [may] 19 she who [does not have it receive no glory].
        20 For there is no glory [...] 21 nor even the one
        (masc.) who [...] 22 For indeed the one [without glory] 23
        [is] a ... [...]. 24 For [...] 25 [...] 26

21 1 [...] 2 [...] 3 [...] 4
[...] 5 [...] 6 [...] 7 [...] 8

12 [...] 13 [...] 14 [...] and the [Zodiacal
signs] 15 [...] and the [...] 16 [...] and [...]

[...] 15 [... And] those that [have likeness] 16
[...] 17 [...]... those who [...] 18 [... the form
...] 19 [...] all the images [of which I] 20 [spoke].
[It is necessary that] 21 all the forms [become] 22
configurations, so that [the forms may] 23 become [the elements
(cf. letters)] 24 themselves [including the] 15 [smooth
(cf. inaspirates)] and the [rough (cf. aspirates), like] 26
[the voices] of animals [...] 27 [...] and the [...] 28
[...] 29 [...] (pages 23-24 missing) 25 1
[...] there.
    But their (the signs of the Zodiac) 2 powers,
which are the angels, 3 are in the form of 4 beasts
and animals. 5 Some among them are 6 [polymorphous]
and contrary to 7 [nature]; they have [sounds] 8 for
(adapted to?) their names, that [is], 9 they are [distinct]
and [different] 10 in [appearance] 11 and [they are
bi-] 12 [formed]. But these that are 13 [homo-] phonic
by a third 14 originate from substance. 15
    And concerning these, all of 16 these
(remarks) are sufficient, 17 since we have (already) spoken
about them. For [this] 18 distribution takes
place 19 again in these regions (i.e., here) in [the manner]
20 we have mentioned from the [beginning]. 21 

        D. The Alphabet and the Configurations of the Soul

1. Vowels and Diphthongs: The First and Second
          Configurations of the Soul

  However, the soul 22 too [has] 23 its configuration,
          although it is diverse. 24 It is [in] 25 [its] form
          26 that the configuration of the only begotten soul 27
          resides. Its configuration 28 is [the second] 26 1
            spherical part--eêiou-- 2 while the first
          goes around [it], 3 the self-begotten soul-- 4 aeêiouô.
          5
    [The] second configuration-- 6 eêiou--derives
          from those [having] 7 two sounds (diphthongs). The first 8
            that suffixes them is [the] 9 [upsilon], and [the iota
          is its] 10 [companion. And these are the ones] 11
          [you know] in [the radiance] 12 of the light.
              [Control] 13 yourselves, receive [the]
          14 imperishable seed, 15 bear fruit, and 16
          do not be 17 attached to your possessions. 18 

2. Tones/Accents

  But know that the oxytones (jise = oxys; or should it be "long vowels"
          = makra = êô) 19 exist among the vowels 20
          and the 21 diphthongs 22 beside them. But the [short
          (vowels) (brachy eo; or should this be barytones = baru =
          gajb?)] 23 are deficient, as well as the 24
          [other sounds that] originate 25 through them. [And] those that
          [are drawn (~perispwmenon i.e., circumflex)], 26 since
          they are intermediate, 27 [are also deficient]. 

3. Consonants and their Combinations

  The sounds of 28 [the semivowels (hemiphwna = z x
          y l m n r s)] are 27 1 superior to the voiceless
          (consonants b g d k p t th ph c = aphôna). 2 And
          those that are double (z x ps = dipla) are superior 3
            to the semivowels which 4 do not change (lmnr =ametabola).
          And the aspirates (dasu = th ph xi) 5 are better
          than the inaspirates (psila = k p t) <of> 6 the mute
          consonants (b g d k p t th ph xi). 7 And as for those
          that are intermediate (b g d = mesa), 8 their
          combinations are many (e.g., by aspirate or "spiritual" precedence = ph
            b p - xi g k - th d t). 9 They are ignorant [of] 10
          the good ones (i.e., combinations) and 11 are combined with
          the worse ones in the [middle]. 12
    [As] in the case 13 of the nomenclature
          for the [gods] 14 and the angels, it is [not that] 15
          they (the consonants) are combined with each other 16 indiscriminately,
          but 17 only that they have 8 a beneficial effect.
          19 It just didn't happen 20 that their intention
          (or: pronunciation) was apparent. 21
    Don't (sg.) [sin anymore], 22 and don't
          dare to 23 have anything to do with sin.
              Now [I] 24 speak to you (sg.) [concerning
          the] 25 [three configurations of the form] 26 of
          the soul.
        
4. Vowels and the Second and Third Configurations
          of the Soul

  [The] 27 third [configuration of the soul] 28 is
          [a sphere and] 28 1 it is a spherical one that goes around
          2 it. From the 3 simple vowels 4 <aaa,>
          eee, <êêê,> iii, ooo,
          uuu, ôôô 5 the diphthongs were
          6 as follows: ai, au, 7 [e]i, eu,
          êu, ou, ôu, oi, hi, 8 [u]i, ôi.
            auei, euêu, oiou, 9 [gg]g, ggg, ggg,
          aiau, 10 [eieu], êu, oiou, ôu,
            ggg, 11 [ggg], aueieu, oiou, êu-- 12
          three times for a male soul. 13 The third 14 configuration
          is spherical; 15 the second configuration, 16 since
          it goes around it, has 17 two sounds (is a diphthong).
              The male soul's 18 third configuration
          19 (consists) of the 20 simple vowels: 21
aaa, eee, êêê, iii, ooo, 22 uuu,
            ôôô, ôôô, ôôô.
          23 [And] this configuration is distinct 24 [from]
          the first, but 25 [they resemble] each other 26 [and
          they] make some 27 [easy sounds] of 28 [this sort:
          aeê]oô (i.e., the protactic vowels of the diphthongs).
          And 29 1 from these (are made) the diphthongs (by appending
          I or u). 2 

5. Vowel Combinations and the Fourth and Fifth Configurations of the Soul

  So also the 3 fourth and the fifth: 4 with regard
          to them, not everything was allowed to be 5 revealed, 6 but only those things that are
          obvious. 7 You (pl.) were taught 8 about them, that
          you should contemplate them 9 in order that they, too, might
          10 seek and find [what] 11 they all are, either 12
          through themselves alone 13 or through one another, 14
          or (seek) to reveal [limits] 15 set from the beginning, 16
          either with reference to themselves alone [or] 17 with reference
          to one another.
              Just as [they (the letters)] 18 coexist
          with each other [in] 19 speech, whether individually 20
          or by similarity, [they are] 21 prepended (or) [they] 22
          are appended. Either their 23 [part] is derivative and 24
          similar, whether through [the] 25 [long (makron)] (vowels
          êô) or [through] 26 those of [dual time value
          (dichronoi aiu), or] 27 through [the short (vowels
          brachy eo)] 28 which are short [...] 29
          [...] 30 1 or the oxytones (or: short vowels) or the 2 intermediate
          tones (i.e., perispômena) or the barytones (or: short vowels). 3

6. Consonant-Vowel Combinations: Syllables

  And (sometimes) <the> consonants 4 exist with the vowels, 5 and
          by turns 6 they are prepended 7 and appended. 8
            They constitute a nomenclature 9 [for] the angels. And (sometimes)
          10 [the] consonants are 11 independent (self-existent?),
          12 [and] diverse-- 13 they (txt. "it": sg. vb w.
          neut. pl. subject?) prefix and they (txt. "it") suffix 14 the
          hidden 15 gods (the graphically unrepresented phenomena of speech?).
          By means of 16 beat and 17 pitch and 18
          silence and attack 19 [they] summon the semivowels, 20
          all of which 21 are subjected to a 22 single [sound].
          Just as it is only 13 the [unchanging (consonants l m n r
            s)] <and> the double (consonants z ch ps) 24 that
          exist among the semivowels (z ch ps l m n r s), 25 the
          aspirates (dasy th ph xi) 26 [and the inaspirates
          (psiloi k p t)] and the 27 [intermediates (b
            g d)] constitute 28 [the voiceless (consonants [mute b
              g d k p t th ph xi]).
          Contrary to] 29 [nature they (the consonants and vowels)]
          are combined 30 [with one another, and] they are separate 31
1 from one another. They are 2 prepended and appended,
          3 and they constitute an 4 ignorant nomenclature.
          5 And they (the resulting syllables) become one or 6 two
          or three or [four] 7 or five or six up to 8 seven
          having a 9 [simple] sound. These that [have] 10 two
          [sounds (diphthongs)] are grouped with [the] 11 [seventeen consonants.
              Among] 12 the previously named (~proônumos)
          [some] are 13 deficient and 14 they are as if [they]
          had no substance, 15 or as if [they] were an image [of] 16
          substance, [or] as if they separate 17 the nature [that is]
          good [from the one] 18 that [is evil] in the [middle.] 19
          And you (sg.) [will assemble] 20 into those (patterns) that
          resemble each other 21 the vowels [together with] 22
          the consonants. Some 23 are: bagad[a]zatha,
          24 beged[e]zeqe, [bêgêdê]
          25 zêthê, [bigidizithi, bogo]
          26 dozotho, [buguduzuthu], 27 bôgôdô[zôthô,
          and] 28 the rest. [And some are]: 29 ba[bebêbibobubô].
          32 1 But the rest are 2 different: abebêbi
3 [b]ob, in order that you (sg.) might [assemble]
          4 them and become separate from the 5 angels. 

7. Arithmology

  And there 6 will be some effects. 7 A good point of departure 
          8 is from 9 [the] Triad. It [extends] 10
          [to that which (i.e., the Dyad)] has need of [the One] 11 [that] confined 
          12 [it in] a shape (the Triad).
          <The> Dyad 13 and the Monad 14 do not resemble
          anything; rather 15 they are principles. 16 The Dyad
          [constitutes] 17 a division [from the] Monad, [and] 18
          [it] belongs to the hypostasis (should this be substrate = hypokeimenon?).
          19 But the Tetrad received (the) [elements] 20 and
          the Pentad 21 received concord, and the 22 [Hexad]
          was perfected by 23 itself. The 24 [Hebdomad] received
          beauty, 25 [and the] Ogdoad 26 [attuned its constituents]
          27 [to harmony], 28 [and the Ennead is] 29
          [honored much more]. 33 1 And the [Decad revealed]
          2 the entire place (i. e., the aeonic realm). 3 But
          the Hendecad and the 4 [Dodecad] have passed over 5 [into
          the boundless], 6 [and] it [is higher than] the 7 Hebdomad
          [which is] 8 [bounded. ...] 9 [...] 10

          promise that [the articulation marks (diairesis)] 18 begin [to
          separate] 19 them by means of 20 a sign [and] 21
          a point, the [uninflected (upright = :) one] 22 and the [inflected
          (bent = klje)] one. 23 So also [are the images]
          24 of being: 25 they derive [from a joining] 26
          of the letters (elements) 27 in [a holy union] 34 1
            according to a [juxtaposition] 2 where they exist independently.
          3 [And] <they> exist with each 4 [other] by generation
          or [by] 5 [their kinship]. And] according to

9. Words

  But there exists gentle [discourse] 21 and there exists
          another 22 discourse [related to] 23 [permanent (ahe
          for rmhe?)] substance 24 of this [sort, by speaking]
          25 of [that which is invisible], 26 and it [manifests]
          27 the difference [between the Same] 28 and the [Different
          and] 36 1 between the whole and a [part] 2 of
          an [indivisible] substance. 3 And [that] power 4 has
          [a] 5 share in [the joy]-- 6 in (both) discord and
          [harmony--] 7 [of their honor], whether 8 [...] 9
            [...] 10 [...] 11 [...] 12 [...]
          13 [...] 14 [...] 15 [... it is] possible
          16 [to know that the things that] exist 17 everywhere
          [are honored] 18 always, 19 [since they] dwell (both)
          with the corporeal 20 and the incorporeal ones. 21
          This is the discourse on the hypostases 22 that one should 23
          [know] in this way. If 24 [they do] not [speak] with one another,
          25 [how then] does it (the discourse) help 26 [those
          who] are troubled [with] 27 [it (the discourse) about that which is] visible?
          28 [Therefore] if one 37 1 knows it, one will
          2 [speak] it. 3
But there are words, some 4 of which are [dual], 5
            [and others] that exist 6 [separately, the ones that pertain]
          7 to [substance (proper nouns?) ...]
          8 [...] 9 [...]
          10 [...] 11 [...] 12 [...] 13
          [and] they [...] 14 ... [...] 15 or those which [...]
          16 [... according to those that perdure] 17 or according
          to [those that] have 18 time . And [these] 19 either
          are separated 20 or they are joined with one another 21
          or with themselves, either [the] 22 diphthongs, or the 23
          simple [vowels], or every [...] 24 or [...] 25 or
          [...] 26 [exist] just as [...] 27 [exist] ... [...]
          28 the [consonants ...] 38 1 they exist individually
          2 until they are divided 3 and joined.

          generate the consonants] 6 [letter] by [letter] ...] 7
            [... difference] 8 [...] 9 [...] 10
          [...] 11 [...] 12 [...] become 13 [...
          being]... 14 [.... ] 15 [They (the letters) will
          count] once 16 [or twice], and thrice 17
          [for the] vowels, 18 and twice 19 [for] the consonants,
          20 [and] once for 21 the entire ensemble, and with 22 uncertainty for 23 [things
          that] are subject to change 24 [as well as those things that] originated 25 [from them] and [everything] 26 thereafter. And 27 they are all [the names] 28
          [at once. They] were 39 1 hidden, but they were pronounced
          2 openly. They did not 3 stop being revealed, 4
            nor did they stop 5 naming the angels. 6 The
          vowels [are joined with] the 8 [consonants, whether] externally
          9 [or] internally, 10 by means of [...] they 11
          said [...] 12 [teach you ...] 13 again [in this way
          they were counted] 14 four times, (and) they were [engendered]
          15 three 16 times, and they became 17
          [twelvefold]. 18 



Being Worthy of and Safeguarding
          the Revelation
  For these reasons we have acquired 19 sufficiency; for it is
        fitting that 20 each one acquire 21 power for himself
        that he may bear fruit, 22 and that we 23 never heap
        24 scorn [on] the mysteries 25 [...] the [...] 26
        For [...] which [is ...] 27 [... the] souls [...] 28
        [... the] signs of the Zodiac [...] 29 [...] 30 [...]
        40 1 a new hypostasis. 2 And the reward which
        will 3 be provided for such a one 4 is salvation.
        5 But the opposite will 6 happen there to the one
        7 who commits sin. [The one who commits] sin 8 by
        himself [...] will be 9 [in a ... in a] 10 [...]
        11 [... these]. 12
    [Ponder them] so that, 13 before you (sg.) examine
        14 what one 15 might [convey] to another, 16
        [you may receive an] exalted power 17 and a divine knowledge 18
        and an ability that 19 cannot be resisted. 20 But
        you (sg.) shall examine 21 who is worthy that he should 22
        reveal them, knowing 23 that they [will ... down] 24
        to the [...] who 25 sin. Therefore [...] 26 [the
        Father ...] 27 [...] 28 [...] 29 [...]
        41 1 that which is fitting. Do not desire 2 to
        empower the sense-perceptible world 3 by not attending to me,
        4 the one who has received the salvation 5 (that
        comes) from the intelligible world. 6
    But as for these <discourses>, beware your 7
          [divulging] them to [any] one. 8 [...] ... 9 [...]
        10 [...] 11 [...] lest [he succeed] 12
        [in understanding them] and take [them away]. 13 [And, as for
        the remainder], 14 I [will speak to] them of the [completion]
        15 [of my discourse] lest 16 the sinful person 17
        [divulge them to others]. 18 They did not understand them, namely
        the embodied 19 souls upon 20 the earth, as well
        as those outside of 21 the body, who are in heaven, 22
        more numerous than the angels.

1. Seals 1-3 The Corporeal: the Worldly and Material
          Levels

  The first 17 [and the] second and the 18 [third]
          are for the worldly 19 and the material. I have 20
          [informed] you concerning these, that you should 21 [guard]
          your bodies. And 22 a sense-perceptible [power] 23
          will [hide] those who will rest, 24 and they will be kept 25
          [from the] passion(s) and division 26 [of the] (incarnational)
          union. 

2. Seals 4-5 The Incorporeal: the Sojourn (Seal
          4) and Repentance (Seal 5)

  The fourth (the Sojourn) 27 [and the] fifth (the Repentance)
          which is above (it, i.e., the Sojourn), 28 [are the ones] you
          have come to know 29 [as divine]. 30 [The fourth,
          concerning that which] 3 1 exists after (i.e., above)
          the [somatic type] 2 and nature, 3 that is, that
          which [is divided in] 4 three. And you [were] 5 [informed]
          about [these and that which is] 6 in three [dimensions] 7
          by these [two (the fourth & fifth?)]. 8 You [were informed
          that it] 9 is incorporeal 10 [...] 11
          and after [...] 12 within [...] 13 every [...] which
          [... and] 14 the things within them. 

3. Seal 5 The Repentance

  The [fifth,] 15 [concerning the] repentance [of] 16
          those that are within me and 17 {concerning those} who sojourn
          in that place (the fourth?). 18 

4. Seal 6 The Self-generated Ones

  But the sixth, 19 concerning the self-generated ones, 20
          concerning the incorporeal being 21 that exists individually
          (cf. the perfect individuals), 22 together with those who abide
          in 23 the truth of the All [in regard to] 24 understanding
          and 25 assurance (or: stability). 

5. Seal 7 The Autogenes

  And the [seventh,] 26 concerning the self-begotten power 27
          which [is the] 28 Third [perfect Mind, 29 [the
          second (after Barbelo) who extended to] 4 1 [the] fourth
          (the Sojourn) for salvation 2 [through] Wisdom. 

6. Seal 8 The Protophanes

  And the eighth, 3 concerning the mind which is 4
          [male, which] appeared 5 [in the beginning (i.e., "Protophanes")],
          as well as the substance 6 [which is incorporeal] and the 7
          [intelligible] world. 

7. Seal 9 The Kalyptos

  The ninth, 8 [concerning the head] of the power 9
          [that] appeared [in the] 10 [beginning. 

8. Seal 10 The Aeon of Barbelo

  The] tenth, [concerning] 11 [Barbelo, the] virgin 12
          [who is male], that is, the Aeon.13 

9. Seals 11-12 The Triple Powered One and the Invisible
          Spirit

  [The eleventh] and [the] 14 [twelfth] speak of the 15
          Invisible One who possesses 16 three powers 17 and
          the insubstantial Spirit 18 who belongs to 19 the
          first unbegotten one (fem., i.e., first unbegotten power of the Triple
          Powered One, which is the Invisible Spirit). 

10. Seal 13 The Unknown Silent One

 
1. Marsanes inquires about the Aeonic Realm of
          the Triple Powered One

  But beyond all of these, 18 I am seeking the kingdom 19
          of the Triple Powered One, 20 which has no beginning. Whence
          21 did he appear and 22 act to fill the 23 the
          entire place (i. e., the aeonic realm) with his power? And 24
          in what way did the unbegotten ones 25 come into existence without
          being begotten? And 26 what are [the] differences among the
          [aeons]? 27 [And] as for those who are unbegotten, 28
          how many [are they]? And in what respect 29 [do they differ]
          from each other? 


2. The Triple Powered One actualizes the Silence
          of the Unknown Silent One

7 1 When I had inquired about these things 2
          I perceived that he (the Triple Powered One) acted 3 from silence.
          He exists 4 prior to those that 5 truly exist, that
          belong to the realm of Being. 6 He (the Triple Powered One)
          is a pre-existent otherness 7 belonging to the one (the Invisible
          Spirit) that 8 actualizes the Silent One. 9 And the
          silence of [that (the Triple Powered One) which follows] 10
          him (the Invisible Spirit) acts. For [so] 11 [long as] the latter
          (the Spirit) [acts], 12 the former (the Triple Powered One)
          [acts also]. 13 The [silence which belongs to the Un-] 14
          begotten One (the Invisible Spirit) is among [the aeons, and from] 15
          the beginning he is in-[substantial]. 16 But the activity of
          17 that One (the Invisible Spirit) <is> the Triple Powered
          One. 18 The Unbegotten One (the Invisible Spirit) is prior to
          19 the Aeon, since he is in-[substantial]. 20
And as for the summit of the 21 silence of the Silent One,
          22 it is possible <for> the summit (i.e., the Invisible Spirit)
          23 of the energy of the Triple 24 Powered One to
          behold it. And the One (the Unknown Silent One) who 25 exists,
          who is silent, [who is] 26 beyond [insubstantiality], 27
          manifested [the Triple] 28 [Powered, First-] 29 Perfect
          One. 

3. The Self-manifestation of the Triple Powered
            One

  [When he appeared] 8 1 to the powers, they rejoiced.
          2 Those that are within me were completed 3 together
          with all the 4 rest. And they all blessed 5 the Triple
          Powered One, 6 one by one, who 7 is [the] First-Perfect
          One, 8 [blessing] him in purity, [every]where 9 praising
          the Lord 10 [who exists] before the All, 11 [who
          (is) the] Triple Powered One. 12 [It did not happen that] their
          worshippings 13 [were audible], but [it was my part] 14
          [to keep on] 15 [inquiring] how they had 16 become
          silent. I would contemplate a 17 power that I hold 18 in
          honor. 

4. The Barbelo Aeon reveals Itself as the Triple
          Powered One's Third Power

  When the third 19 power (i.e. the Barbelo Aeon) of the Triple
          Powered One 20 contemplated him (the Triple Powered One), 21
          it said to me (Marsanes), "Be silent 22 lest you should know
          and flee 23 and come before me. But 24 know that
          this One was 25 [silent], and concentrate on understanding.
          26 For [the power still] keeps 27 [guiding] me into
          28 [the Aeon which] is Barbelo, 29 [the] male [Virgin]." 


5. Marsanes explains the Barbelo Aeon's Deployment
          from the Invisible Spirit

9 1 For this reason the 2 Virgin became male
          (as nous, the Aeon of Barbelo), 3 because she had separated
          from the male (i.e., the Invisible Spirit). The 4 Knowledge
          stood outside of him, 5 as if belonging to him. 6
          And she who exists is she who sought. 7 She is situated just
          as 8 the Triple Powered One is situated. 9 She withdrew
          10 from [these] two [powers] (the first two powers of the Triple
          Powered One), 11 since she exists [outside of] 12 the
          Great One (the Invisible Spirit), [seeing what] 13 is above
          [her, the Perfect One (the Triple Powered One)] 14 who is silent,
          [who has] 15 this [commandment] 16 to be silent.
          His knowledge (gnôsis; cf. Mind) 17 and his hypostasis
          (hypostasis;  cf. Existence) 18 and his activity
          (energeia;  cf. Life) 19 are those things that the
          power (dynamis, i.e. Barbelo) 20 of the Triple Powered
          One expressed: 21 


6. The Barbelo Aeon describes the Praise of the
          Triple Powered One

"We all have 22 withdrawn to ourselves. We have [become] 23
          silent, [and] 24 when we [too] came to know [that he is] 25
          the Triple Powered One, [we] 26 bowed down; we [gave glory and
          we] 27 blessed him. [He conferred] 28 upon us [a
          great revelation]." 29 
    [Again] the Invisible [Spirit] 10 1
          ran up 2 to his place. The entire place (i. e., the aeonic realm)
          3 was revealed, the entire place unfolded 4 <until>
          he reached the upper region. 5 Again he went forth and caused
          the 6 entire place to be illuminated, and the entire 7
            place was illuminated.
        
 
1. Vowels and Diphthongs: The First and Second
          Configurations of the Soul

  However, the soul 22 too [has] 23 its configuration,
          although it is diverse. 24 It is [in] 25 [its] form
          26 that the configuration of the only begotten soul 27
          resides. Its configuration 28 is [the second] 26 1
            spherical part--eêiou-- 2 while the first
          goes around [it], 3 the self-begotten soul-- 4 aeêiouô.
          5
    [The] second configuration-- 6 eêiou--derives
          from those [having] 7 two sounds (diphthongs). The first 8
            that suffixes them is [the] 9 [upsilon], and [the iota
          is its] 10 [companion. And these are the ones] 11
          [you know] in [the radiance] 12 of the light.
              [Control] 13 yourselves, receive [the]
          14 imperishable seed, 15 bear fruit, and 16
          do not be 17 attached to your possessions. 18 

2. Tones/Accents

  But know that the oxytones (jise = oxys; or should it be "long vowels"
          = makra = êô) 19 exist among the vowels 20
          and the 21 diphthongs 22 beside them. But the [short
          (vowels) (brachy eo; or should this be barytones = baru =
          gajb?)] 23 are deficient, as well as the 24
          [other sounds that] originate 25 through them. [And] those that
          [are drawn (~perispwmenon i.e., circumflex)], 26 since
          they are intermediate, 27 [are also deficient]. 

3. Consonants and their Combinations

  The sounds of 28 [the semivowels (hemiphwna = z x
          y l m n r s)] are 27 1 superior to the voiceless
          (consonants b g d k p t th ph c = aphôna). 2 And
          those that are double (z x ps = dipla) are superior 3
            to the semivowels which 4 do not change (lmnr =ametabola).
          And the aspirates (dasu = th ph xi) 5 are better
          than the inaspirates (psila = k p t) <of> 6 the mute
          consonants (b g d k p t th ph xi). 7 And as for those
          that are intermediate (b g d = mesa), 8 their
          combinations are many (e.g., by aspirate or "spiritual" precedence = ph
            b p - xi g k - th d t). 9 They are ignorant [of] 10
          the good ones (i.e., combinations) and 11 are combined with
          the worse ones in the [middle]. 12
    [As] in the case 13 of the nomenclature
          for the [gods] 14 and the angels, it is [not that] 15
          they (the consonants) are combined with each other 16 indiscriminately,
          but 17 only that they have 8 a beneficial effect.
          19 It just didn't happen 20 that their intention
          (or: pronunciation) was apparent. 21
    Don't (sg.) [sin anymore], 22 and don't
          dare to 23 have anything to do with sin.
              Now [I] 24 speak to you (sg.) [concerning
          the] 25 [three configurations of the form] 26 of
          the soul.
        
4. Vowels and the Second and Third Configurations
          of the Soul

  [The] 27 third [configuration of the soul] 28 is
          [a sphere and] 28 1 it is a spherical one that goes around
          2 it. From the 3 simple vowels 4 <aaa,>
          eee, <êêê,> iii, ooo,
          uuu, ôôô 5 the diphthongs were
          6 as follows: ai, au, 7 [e]i, eu,
          êu, ou, ôu, oi, hi, 8 [u]i, ôi.
            auei, euêu, oiou, 9 [gg]g, ggg, ggg,
          aiau, 10 [eieu], êu, oiou, ôu,
            ggg, 11 [ggg], aueieu, oiou, êu-- 12
          three times for a male soul. 13 The third 14 configuration
          is spherical; 15 the second configuration, 16 since
          it goes around it, has 17 two sounds (is a diphthong).
              The male soul's 18 third configuration
          19 (consists) of the 20 simple vowels: 21
aaa, eee, êêê, iii, ooo, 22 uuu,
            ôôô, ôôô, ôôô.
          23 [And] this configuration is distinct 24 [from]
          the first, but 25 [they resemble] each other 26 [and
          they] make some 27 [easy sounds] of 28 [this sort:
          aeê]oô (i.e., the protactic vowels of the diphthongs).
          And 29 1 from these (are made) the diphthongs (by appending
          I or u). 2 

5. Vowel Combinations and the Fourth and Fifth Configurations of the Soul

  So also the 3 fourth and the fifth: 4 with regard
          to them, not everything was allowed to be 5 revealed, 6 but only those things that are
          obvious. 7 You (pl.) were taught 8 about them, that
          you should contemplate them 9 in order that they, too, might
          10 seek and find [what] 11 they all are, either 12
          through themselves alone 13 or through one another, 14
          or (seek) to reveal [limits] 15 set from the beginning, 16
          either with reference to themselves alone [or] 17 with reference
          to one another.
              Just as [they (the letters)] 18 coexist
          with each other [in] 19 speech, whether individually 20
          or by similarity, [they are] 21 prepended (or) [they] 22
          are appended. Either their 23 [part] is derivative and 24
          similar, whether through [the] 25 [long (makron)] (vowels
          êô) or [through] 26 those of [dual time value
          (dichronoi aiu), or] 27 through [the short (vowels
          brachy eo)] 28 which are short [...] 29
          [...] 30 1 or the oxytones (or: short vowels) or the 2 intermediate
          tones (i.e., perispômena) or the barytones (or: short vowels). 3

6. Consonant-Vowel Combinations: Syllables

  And (sometimes) <the> consonants 4 exist with the vowels, 5 and
          by turns 6 they are prepended 7 and appended. 8
            They constitute a nomenclature 9 [for] the angels. And (sometimes)
          10 [the] consonants are 11 independent (self-existent?),
          12 [and] diverse-- 13 they (txt. "it": sg. vb w.
          neut. pl. subject?) prefix and they (txt. "it") suffix 14 the
          hidden 15 gods (the graphically unrepresented phenomena of speech?).
          By means of 16 beat and 17 pitch and 18
          silence and attack 19 [they] summon the semivowels, 20
          all of which 21 are subjected to a 22 single [sound].
          Just as it is only 13 the [unchanging (consonants l m n r
            s)] <and> the double (consonants z ch ps) 24 that
          exist among the semivowels (z ch ps l m n r s), 25 the
          aspirates (dasy th ph xi) 26 [and the inaspirates
          (psiloi k p t)] and the 27 [intermediates (b
            g d)] constitute 28 [the voiceless (consonants [mute b
              g d k p t th ph xi]).
          Contrary to] 29 [nature they (the consonants and vowels)]
          are combined 30 [with one another, and] they are separate 31
1 from one another. They are 2 prepended and appended,
          3 and they constitute an 4 ignorant nomenclature.
          5 And they (the resulting syllables) become one or 6 two
          or three or [four] 7 or five or six up to 8 seven
          having a 9 [simple] sound. These that [have] 10 two
          [sounds (diphthongs)] are grouped with [the] 11 [seventeen consonants.
              Among] 12 the previously named (~proônumos)
          [some] are 13 deficient and 14 they are as if [they]
          had no substance, 15 or as if [they] were an image [of] 16
          substance, [or] as if they separate 17 the nature [that is]
          good [from the one] 18 that [is evil] in the [middle.] 19
          And you (sg.) [will assemble] 20 into those (patterns) that
          resemble each other 21 the vowels [together with] 22
          the consonants. Some 23 are: bagad[a]zatha,
          24 beged[e]zeqe, [bêgêdê]
          25 zêthê, [bigidizithi, bogo]
          26 dozotho, [buguduzuthu], 27 bôgôdô[zôthô,
          and] 28 the rest. [And some are]: 29 ba[bebêbibobubô].
          32 1 But the rest are 2 different: abebêbi
3 [b]ob, in order that you (sg.) might [assemble]
          4 them and become separate from the 5 angels. 

7. Arithmology

  And there 6 will be some effects. 7 A good point of departure 
          8 is from 9 [the] Triad. It [extends] 10
          [to that which (i.e., the Dyad)] has need of [the One] 11 [that] confined 
          12 [it in] a shape (the Triad).
          <The> Dyad 13 and the Monad 14 do not resemble
          anything; rather 15 they are principles. 16 The Dyad
          [constitutes] 17 a division [from the] Monad, [and] 18
          [it] belongs to the hypostasis (should this be substrate = hypokeimenon?).
          19 But the Tetrad received (the) [elements] 20 and
          the Pentad 21 received concord, and the 22 [Hexad]
          was perfected by 23 itself. The 24 [Hebdomad] received
          beauty, 25 [and the] Ogdoad 26 [attuned its constituents]
          27 [to harmony], 28 [and the Ennead is] 29
          [honored much more]. 33 1 And the [Decad revealed]
          2 the entire place (i. e., the aeonic realm). 3 But
          the Hendecad and the 4 [Dodecad] have passed over 5 [into
          the boundless], 6 [and] it [is higher than] the 7 Hebdomad
          [which is] 8 [bounded. ...] 9 [...] 10 

8. Syllables and Nouns

9. Words

  But there exists gentle [discourse] 21 and there exists

          25 [how then] does it (the discourse) help 26 [those
          who] are troubled [with] 27 [it (the discourse) about that which is] visible?
          28 [Therefore] if one 37 1 knows it, one will
          2 [speak] it. 3
But there are words, some 4 of which are [dual], 5
            [and others] that exist 6 [separately, the ones that pertain]
          7 to [substance (proper nouns?) ...]
          8 [...] 9 [...]
          10 [...] 11 [...] 12 [...] 13
          [and] they [...] 14 ... [...] 15 or those which [...]
          16 [... according to those that perdure] 17 or according
          to [those that] have 18 time . And [these] 19 either
          are separated 20 or they are joined with one another 21
          or with themselves, either [the] 22 diphthongs, or the 23
          simple [vowels], or every [...] 24 or [...] 25 or
          [...] 26 [exist] just as [...] 27 [exist] ... [...]
          28 the [consonants ...] 38 1 they exist individually
          2 until they are divided 3 and joined.
              Now some 4 are able 5 [to
          generate the consonants] 6 [letter] by [letter] ...] 7
            [... difference] 8 [...] 9 [...] 10
          [...] 11 [...] 12 [...] become 13 [...
          being]... 14 [.... ] 15 [They (the letters) will
          count] once 16 [or twice], and thrice 17
          [for the] vowels, 18 and twice 19 [for] the consonants,
          20 [and] once for 21 the entire ensemble, and with 22 uncertainty for 23 [things
          that] are subject to change 24 [as well as those things that] originated 25 [from them] and [everything] 26 thereafter. And 27 they are all [the names] 28
          [at once. They] were 39 1 hidden, but they were pronounced
          2 openly. They did not 3 stop being revealed, 4
            nor did they stop 5 naming the angels. 6 The
          vowels [are joined with] the 8 [consonants, whether] externally
          9 [or] internally, 10 by means of [...] they 11
          said [...] 12 [teach you ...] 13 again [in this way
          they were counted] 14 four times, (and) they were [engendered]
          15 three 16 times, and they became 17
          [twelvefold]. 18
